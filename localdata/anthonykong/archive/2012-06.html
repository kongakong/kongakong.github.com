<h2>"Bobby Fischer" by David Tang</h2>
<p>An old article I stacked away for some time. It was written in 2004 I suppose.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the worst player in the world calling the best player in the world.&#8221; So Henry Kissinger telephoned Bobby Fischer, who was stewing in one of his capricious stupors, and urged him to fly to Reykjavik for the World Chess Championship in July 1972. Everything had been set up: the reigning Russian champion Boris Spassky was already in Iceland; all the tickets for the match in the insipid sports hall, the Laugardalsholl, had been sold out; the prize money at US$250,000 was 20 times more than the last world championship, and the entire fraternity of chess was waiting for the clash of the titans. The Soviets had dominated the game of chess since World War II, but now came the thrill of an unlikely American trying to break that supremacy. The Cold War at the time also gave the entire event a real frisson, for the confrontation of the Soviet champion and American champion on the chess board was seen to be a fight between Democracy and Communism, a combat between the intense hostilities of the world&#8217;s two super-powers. It was the High Noon of chess, and ideologies. But Mr. Fischer was prevaricating.</p>

<p>I well remember my own adolescent excitement during that summer. I was eighteen and had been obsessed with playing chess almost from my first day at boarding school, when I couldn&#8217;t read English and turned to chess notations. For 5 years I played hours of chess each day and travelled around England taking part in tournaments. And my inspiration was Fischer. To me, he was a genius who made moves on the chess board that nobody had dared or thought of before. I had studied all the games of the Russian masters, particularly Botvinnik and Petrosian, whom I respected with awe, but they were like robots, reliable, methodical and effective but rather mechanical. Yet when I got to know the play of Fischer, I began to realize that he gave elegance and artistry to the game. He brought new blood to chess that was not unlike the arrival of Nijinsky at Ballet Russe.</p>

<p>Fischer did eventually turn up at Reykjavik, but a couple of days late amidst all the tension of a suffering and waiting crowd. His idiosyncratic and volatile behaviour, coupled with his appalling manners, was already well-known and much dreaded. Therefore, we disciples were relieved that he got on his plane. Everyday we anxiously followed his moves on the wireless and television. The suspense in a chess game, which is seemingly slow, is however as intense as any fast game. Cricket fans will tell you the same. In the end, Fischer triumphed and became world champion. The Russians&#8217; stronghold was broken and her National pride lost. Poor Spassky!
Then, just as one might expect from a man with an undecipherable complex, Fischer went into hiding and after an appearance on television with Bob Hope, he became a recluse from which he emerged only fleetingly for a re-match with Spassky in 1992. He thrashed his former opponent 10-5. But the only trouble, even though he won US$3.3million, was that the match was played in Yugoslavia during U.N. sanctions and a warrant for his arrest in the U.S. was issued immediately afterwards. Ever since, Fischer has been a fugitive, mainly living secretly in the Philippines and Japan and occasionally making extremely provocative radio interviews. On the trauma of 9/11, Fischer praised the terrorists&#8217; attack, saying that America should be &#8220;wiped out&#8221;. He also described Jews, even though he himself is Jewish, as &#8220;thieving, lying bastards.&#8221;</p>

<p>Last July, he was arrested at Narita Airport for allegedly using an invalid U.S. passport and is now languishing in jail, with the possibility of being extradited to his native America to face his indictment for which he could go to prison for 10 years.
I remember asking myself when I was last in Reykjavik: &#8220;How do and can we admire a genius who is however clearly evil in his thoughts?&#8221; Fischer&#8217;s anti-semetism and moral turpitude are repellent. Yet he is a stupefying wonder in chess whose record stands above all other players, lending magic to this majestic game of the intellect. Let&#8217;s hope at least that his Japanese girlfriend Miss Watai (who has described herself as a &#8220;pawn&#8221; that might turn into a queen!) might bring him round to his senses so that Fischer, who forfeited his world title in 1975, could once more contribute to the brilliance of chess, but without the ugliness of his tarnished vileness.</p>

<p>It is a very old news, back in 2004:</p>

<p>&#8220;Three gamblers who won £1.3m at the Ritz Club casino using technology worthy of James Bond have been allowed to keep their winnings. The three people—described as a “chic and beautiful” Hungarian woman and two “elegant” Serbian men—were accused of using a laser scanner hidden inside a mobile phone to measure the speed of the ball on the roulette table at the St James club. This beamed the data to a microcomputer, which predicted where it would land, flashing the information on the phone&#8217;s screen. The trio was arrested in March.</p>

<p>London&#8217;s police have not said whether they found such a device. But on December 7th they announced that no further action would be taken and that their inquiry was over. The three suspects, who were on bail, are now free to leave Britain. The Times newspaper reported that because the high-tech scanner didn&#8217;t interfere with the ball or roulette wheel, the gamblers had not broken the law.&#8221;</p>

<p>It will not be hard to implement in Android or iOS these days, I suppose? :-)</p>

<h2>Japan before 1937</h2>
<p>I just realise I know next to nothing about what was happening in Japan prior to the 1937 Japanese invasion of China.</p>

<p>It seems like, leading up to 1937, there were series of political assassinations and military mutinies that kept pushing Japan politic into far right. Finally in 1937 the Japanese army in Manchu, literally out of control, started an attack on Chinese territory which immediately escalated to a full scale war. Japanese at the time supported the invasion because of both the poor economic condition at home and ambition of land-grab as inspired by Hitler of Nazi Germany.</p>

<p>Should study more about this time period in Asia.</p>

<h2>Chales Dicken and USA </h2>
<p>It is my very simple, naive understanding of the love-hate relationship Chales Dicken and USA: Initially Americans like Chales Dicken because of his works. When Chales first visited USA, the host threw a lavish ball for him. However as tour went on, Chales was upset by the lack of idealism in American politics and the mannerism of the people he met. At the end, he fell out with America when he realised the privacy of his novels in USA has costed him a hugh sum of lost income. He wrote of USA in a very negative light after he was back in England. It took years before the relationship was mended.</p>

<p>Finally figure out the back button title not set issue.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s what I have been doing in the originating controller&#8217;s <code>prepareForSegue</code> method:</p>

<pre>
        self.navigationItem.backBarButtonItem.title = @"Back";
        </pre>

<p>It has not effect. The <code>backBarButtonItem</code> is probably not initialised yet. (Nothing will come out of a call to a nil object).</p>

<p>I should actually create an instance of the <code>UIBarButtonItem</code></p>

<pre>

        self.navigationItem.backBarButtonItem = [[UIBarButtonItem alloc] initWithTitle:@"Back" 
style:UIBarButtonItemStylePlain target:nil action:nil];
