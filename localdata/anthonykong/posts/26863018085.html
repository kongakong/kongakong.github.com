<p>From ‘The Grand Chessboard’ (1997) by Zbigniew Brzezinski,</p>

<p><em>&#8220;Even so, the Roman Empire was not unique. The Roman and the Chinese empires emerged almost contemporaneously, though neither was aware of the other.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>It is not entirely true. There are mentioning of a big empire in the far west named &#8216;Great Qin&#8217; (大秦) in ancient official documentation e.g. the Book of Late Han. But the majority of populace probably did not know it.</p>
