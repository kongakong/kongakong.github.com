<h2>Market hasn't really changed all these years</h2>
<p>Quoted from &#8216;Winston’s War: Churchill, 1940-1945” by Max Hastings:</p>

<p>The <i>Financial Times</i> columnist Lex wrote on June 23 [1941]: &#8220;Markets spent the morning trying to make up their minds whether the German aggression against Russia was a bull or a bear&#8230; The majority concluded that whatever happened we could hardly be worse off as a result of Hitler&#8217;s latest somersault.&#8221;</p>
