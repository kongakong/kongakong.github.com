<h2>C refresher (3)</h2>
<p>From <strong>arc4rand</strong> man page:</p>

<pre><code>The random() function will by default produce a sequence of numbers that
 can be duplicated by calling srandom() with '1' as the seed.  The
 srandom() function may be called with any arbitrary seed value to get
 slightly more unpredictable numbers.  It is important to remember that
 the random() function is entirely predictable, and is therefore not of
 use where knowledge of the sequence of numbers may be of benefit to an
 attacker.

 The arc4rand() function will return very good quality random numbers,
 slightly better suited for security-related purposes.  The random numbers
 from arc4rand() are seeded from the entropy device if it is available.
