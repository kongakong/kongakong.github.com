<h2>XCode linker error</h2>
<p>An old project was created for iOS 5. When trying to re-run it, I got these error messages</p>

<pre><code>Undefined symbols for architecture armv7:
  "_OBJC_CLASS_$_AVCaptureSession", referenced from:
       objc-class-ref in MNoteMediaPlayViewController.o
 ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture armv7
 clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
</code></pre>

<p>Do not recall this kind of trouble before with iOS upgrade.</p>

<p>Set the &#8216;Deployment Target&#8217; to iOS6, clean and rebuilt but it did not work.</p>

<p>AVFoundation Framework is actually dropped out from &#8220;Link Binary with Libraries&#8221; section. Re-adding the framework fixes the issue.</p>
