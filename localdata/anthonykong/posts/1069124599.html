<h2>UIViewController::viewDidLoad is not called</h2>
<p>Spent an hour to check why my <strong>viewDidLoad()</strong> method was not called.</p>

<p>Breakpoints, debugger, documentation, online forum and whatnot were tried but of no avail.</p>

<p>It turned out I have overridden the wrong method: I have overridden the <strong>viewDidUnload()</strong> instead. Very obviously I removed the wrong part of code template that were generated by Xcode during project creation.</p>

<p>Epic fail.</p>
