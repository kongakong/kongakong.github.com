<h2>Why do you need explicitly have the “self” argument into a Python method?</h2>
<p>like to quote Peters&#8217; Zen of Python. &#8220;Explicit is better than implicit.&#8221;</p>

<p>In Java and C++, &#8216;this.&#8217; can be deduced, except when you have variable names that make it impossible to deduce. So you sometimes need it and sometimes don&#8217;t.</p>

<p>Python elects to make things like this explicit rather than based on a rule.</p>

<p>Additionally, since nothing is implied or assumed, parts of the implementation are exposed. self.__class__, self.__dict__ and other &#8220;internal&#8221; structures are available in an obvious way.</p>
