<h2>TpLink ADSL2 Modem woe</h2>
<p>Turns out the modems have issue with TPG, and the problem can only be fixed by refreshing the firmware. But when I discovered it, I have already spent hours to isolate the problem.</p>

<p>Most people reports instant &#8220;plug-and-play&#8221; experience. It is probably because the currently available retail units are of more recent version and already have the firmware sorted out. Not my case. I ordered the modem online.</p>
