<h2>Recapitalize the poors</h2>
<p>Heard this idea from Phillip Blond here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/bigideas/big-society--philip-blond/4217882">http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/bigideas/big-society&#8212;philip-blond/4217882</a></p>

<p>Quote:</p>

<p>&#8220;So, in Britain, housing benefit, for example, you know certain families will be on it for 20 years.  That income stream has probably paid for the original property three times over and there&#8217;s no benefit to the tenant and there is no benefit to the government.</p>

<p>What if we could capitalise or front-load these sorts of benefits such that they were 
transformative and people were able to bounce themselves out of the situation? &#8230; What if we could front-load that, give that to the mother and she could become educated?  It would give her a far greater earning power and deliver far more to the family&#8221;</p>
