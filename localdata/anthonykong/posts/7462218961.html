<p>&#8220;<b>Get rid of self:</b> I think this has been addressed in the responses; it&#8217;s not as easy as you&#8217;d think, and there are important advantages to the uniform interpretation of methods as &#8220;just functions that get called in a funky way&#8221;. In Ruby, everything is a method, or an anonymous block, and there are no &#8220;free functions&#8221;. Python uses the complimentary approach, treating functions as first-class citizens. Both approaches are complete; they are however incompatible, and you can&#8217;t easily morph one into the other. (Personally, I find that the criticm of explicit self has about as much merit as the criticism of Python&#8217;s use of whitespace.)&#8221;</p>
