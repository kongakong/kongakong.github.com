<blockquote><p>You can be right for the wrong reasons or wrong for the right rea- sons, but to the market you&#8217;re just plain right or wrong. Compare this to the story of the teacher who asks if anyone in the class can name two pronouns. When no one volunteers, the teacher calls on Tommy who responds, &#8220;Who, me?&#8221; To the market, Tommy is right and therefore, despite being unlikely to get an A in English, he&#8217;s rich.</p></blockquote>
