<p>Finally reached the final chapter of the book.</p>

<p><em>The point of departure for the needed [US] policy has to be hard-nosed recognition of the three unprecedented conditions that currently define the geopolitical state of world affairs: for the first time in history, (1) a single state is a truly global power, (2) a non-Eurasian state is globally the preeminent state, and (3) the globe&#8217;s central arena, Eurasia, is dominated by a non-Eurasian power.</em></p>

<p>One of the interesting theme in this book is that it has an taken-for-granted conviction that USA <em>The Only Global Power on Earth</em> is a given. The author does not even try to explain why it should be the case.  The whole book is basically a guide or a blueprint of how to project American influence onto Eurasia, the most important landmass on Earth.</p>

<p>This book is still relevant today because it helps one to understand the underlying principle of USA&#8217;s foreign policy since the G. W. Bush/Neocon era. ( You probably can argue it is not entirely different from that before then)</p>
