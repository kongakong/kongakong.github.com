<p>I think I finally understand what the problem is. </p>

<p>In previous version of Xcode (prior to 4.3), it will install the llvm-gcc and the &#8216;original&#8217; gcc.</p>

<p>gcc will invoke the llvm-gcc and gcc-4.2 will invoke the GNU gcc.</p>

<p>However, since 4.3, these command line tools will not be installed by default. We can have the command line tools like svn, make and gcc installed by download the &#8216;command line tools for OSX&#8217; in XCode.</p>

<p>However, the package does not include GNU gcc. </p>

<p>It is the next problem I have to fix.</p>
