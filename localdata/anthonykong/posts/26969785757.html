<p>From ‘The Grand Chessboard’ (1997) by Zbigniew Brzezinski,</p>

<p><em>&#8220;Never before has a populist democracy attained international supremacy. But the pursuit of power is not a goal that commands popular passion, except in conditions of a sudden threat or challenge to the public&#8217;s sense of domestic well-being. The economic self-denial (that is, defense spending) and the human sacrifice (casualties even among professional soldiers) required in the effort are uncongenial to democratic instincts. Democracy is inimical to imperial mobilization.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>Democractic vales are inherently contradictory to empire building&#8230;</p>
