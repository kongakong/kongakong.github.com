<p>Installing Ubuntu 12.04 server. </p>

<p>Used these options: encrypted home directory and LVM</p>

<p>The installation is certainly more complicated than the desktop edition in the sense that it will expect the user to be able to answer certain technical questions. </p>

<p><br/>
Choose to add additional packages manually. However, the aptitude 0.6.6 interface is not intuitive to use. </p>

<p>Therefore, after the machine was rebooted, I did a <code>apt-get update</code> then <code>apt-get install </code> the packages that I want to play with. Old school.</p>
