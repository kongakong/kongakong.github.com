<p>Just found an old receipt for 4&#160;GB RAM I purchased on 12 Aug 2009. It was for my last Mac Book Pro (pre-unibody model). It costed me A$220.</p>

<p>And about a week, I spent less than this amount and got myself 16G RAM to upgrade my iMac.</p>

<p>OK, they are of different form factor, but I still do not expect this price differential.</p>
