<h2>Common Python Beginner Mistake (2) - return value 'None'</h2>
The following statements look very innocent.

<pre class="brush:python">
q = 123
...
q = l.append('b')
...
</pre>

<p>
Beginner will only discover a problem when they try to use the variable &#8216;q&#8217; later down the track. They will be surprised that the variable &#8216;q&#8217;, for some reasons, has been set to None.
</p>

<pre class="brush:python">
print q+1
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'int'

</pre>

<p>
Most developers from static languages backgrounnd are used to have the compilers to catch this kind of programming error, namely, a function that returns nothing (&#8216;void&#8217;) should not appear in the RHS of an assignment operand.
</p>

<p>

But it is not the case for python. If a function returns nothing, the variable on the LHS will be set to None

</p>

<p>
It is a very subtle problem. Beginners may have written the assignment due to mistake or oversight. Then they tend to spend a lot of time to trace down the &#8216;bug&#8217;
