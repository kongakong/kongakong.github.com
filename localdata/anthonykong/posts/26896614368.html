<p>From ‘The Grand Chessboard’ (1997) by Zbigniew Brzezinski,</p>

<p><em>&#8220;The overseas British Empire was initially acquired through a combination of exploration, trade, and conquest. But much like its Roman and Chinese predecessors or its French and Spanish rivals, it also derived a great deal of its staying power from the perception of British cultural superiority.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>&#8216;Cultural superiority&#8217; as the key to the staying power of an empire is the main theme in the book so far</p>
