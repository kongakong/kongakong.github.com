<h2>What is the difference between a porcupine, hedgehog and echidna?</h2>
<p>They are completely different animals. </p>

<p><br/>
Porcupines are rodents, hedgehogs are insectivores and echidnas are monotremes (they are the only mammals, apart from the duck-billed platypus, which lay eggs). </p>

<p><br/>
The fact that they have all developed spines for protection is an example of convergent evolution (where different species evolve similar solutions to a similar problem).</p>
