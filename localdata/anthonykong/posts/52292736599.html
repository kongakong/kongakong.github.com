<p>Health system of USA is odd. For example, Oregon uses a lottery based system to allocate health care coverage - a scarce resource - to its citizens.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Health_Plan">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<pre><code>New enrollment in the program was closed from mid-2004 until early 
2008, when a lottery-based system was introduced. Tens of thousands 
of Oregonians signed up, competing for 3,000 new spots in the plan.
</code></pre>

<p>It  is basically saying that the policy makers have given up on trying to design and implement a system to allocate the resource based on any meaningful and measurable metrics.</p>
