<h2>Donkey anaphora</h2>
<p>It refers to the linguistic analysis, in the area of formal logic, of the sentence &#8220;Every farmer who owns a donkey beats it&#8221;.</p>

<p>Who would have thought this simple sentence is studied so extensively.</p>

<p>My feeling* is  if we analyse semantic of a sentence based on solely its syntactical  structure, we will not go very far. It is because a human brain does not parse and understand a sentence in insolation. A lot of lateral association and re-interpretation happens in the process.</p>

<ul><li>I really have nothing profound to add to this topic.</li>
