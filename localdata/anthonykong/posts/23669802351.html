<h2>"12 Byzantine Rulers: The History of The Byzantine Empire" by Lars Brownworth</h2>
<p>Just finished the podcast series (total to 6.7 hours). The story of Byzantine Empire is amazing. Lars has kept very good pace in the narrative. The materials are not too light or too dense. </p>

<p><br/>
Maybe the history is already full of  drama, plots and intricacy by itself, I feel like I have been listening to an hours-long opening sequence of an American action movie: explosions every five sec here and there with action-packed stunts and acrobatic </p>



<p>Absolutely a great introduction to Byzantine history for someone who knows next to nothing about this splendid empire.</p>
