<p>Churchill&#8217;s influence in Washington has  declined significantly  after 1942. While he still occupy the imagination of general population in USA, the President and the military were basically holding a cold attitude toward Churchill.</p>

<p><br/>
The President, FDR, was probably not pleased by the fact that Churchill has stolen limelight from him. Or he simply was never as keen to develop a personal relationship with Churchill. Churchill always entertained a &#8216;romantic&#8217; view that a bond between national leaders can sway the course of history. The sentiment was not shared by FDR. </p>

<p><br/>
As for the US military, they have long questioned the British&#8217;s determination of winning this war. British has often, in the view of Americans, too cautious and risk averse to take on the German force. But who could blame the Brit who, in 1942, was no match to German&#8217;s war machine?</p>

<p><br/>
Churchill therefore preferred to invade Europe from Italy. It would make good his promise to Stalin that the Ally will fight along side the Russian and this war plan may minimize  possible causality (American force was not ready for big war theatre yet). </p>

<p><br/>
However, the terrain in Italy proved to be a disadvantage to the American force whose military doctrines and tactics rely heavily on large scale use of mechanised weapons. The very dogged determination of German to hold the ground, outstanding discipline and tactics also made the Ally gain very little despite the considerable commitment of force. </p>

<p><br/>
Since Churchill has sold this Italian strategy eagerly to the Americans, the Americans began to doubt the soundness of his military judgement.  </p>

<p><br/>
His influence was in decline as a result.</p>

<p><br/>
I suppose  this is the dynamics that drives some dictators to wage wars after wars: The easiest way for a power-that-be to continue to hold on to the influence and power is by continuously engineer a crisis situation in which all potential challengers are held at bay due to ongoing, military or political, mobilisation. </p>

<p><br/>
That&#8217;s why, I speculate, even after annexation of Poland and other European countries, a very substantial territorial gain,  Hitler still wanted to invade Russia. </p>

<p><br/>
That&#8217;s why Chairman Mao initialised one political campaigns after another. It helped him to hold on to the power, even though the consequence is the widespread of poverty and misery, and Cultural Revolution being one of the worst humane disaster in history.</p>
