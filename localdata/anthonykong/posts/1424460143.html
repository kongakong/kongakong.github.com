</ul><p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<ul><li><p>A text corpus is a large, structured collection of texts. NLTK comes with many corpora, e.g., the Brown Corpus, nltk.corpus.brown.</p></li>
<li><p>Some text corpora are categorized, e.g., by genre or topic; sometimes the categories of a corpus overlap each other.</p></li>
<li><p>A conditional frequency distribution is a collection of frequency distributions, each one for a different condition. They can be used for counting word frequencies, given a context or a genre.</p></li>
<li><p>Python programs more than a few lines long should be entered using a text editor, saved to a file with a .py extension, and accessed using an import statement.</p></li>
<li><p>Python functions permit you to associate a name with a particular block of code, and re-use that code as often as necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>Some functions, known as &#8220;methods&#8221;, are associated with an object and we give the object name followed by a period followed by the function, like this: x.funct(y), e.g., word.isalpha().</p></li>
<li><p>WordNet is a semantically-oriented dictionary of English, consisting of synonym sets — or synsets — and organized into a network.</p></li>
<li><p>Some functions are not available by default, but must be accessed using Python&#8217;s import statement.</p></li>
