<h2>"Growing up Asian in Australia" by Alice Pung</h2>
<p>Another literary detour.</p>

<p><br/>
This book is a refreshing read for me. First of all it has a mix of writing (and drawing!) styles. The stories themselves cut across many different times, backgrounds and experience. They tell us about many kinds of relationships: between parents and children, between grandparents and grandkids, between the sicks and the carers, between the bullies and the victims&#8230; Some stories makes you feel angry, some make you feel sad.</p>

<p><br/>
I think Alice has done a fantastic jobs as an editor. Wonder how she sourced these stories from such a diverse group of people in the first place.</p>
