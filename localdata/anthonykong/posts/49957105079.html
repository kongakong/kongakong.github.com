<p>Deep brain stimulation is becoming very precise. This technique allows surgeons to place electrodes in almost any area of the brain, and turn them up or down &#8212; like a radio dial or thermostat &#8212; to correct dysfunction. Andres Lozano offers a dramatic look at emerging techniques, in which a woman with Parkinson&#8217;s instantly stops shaking and brain areas eroded by Alzheimer&#8217;s are brought back to life. (Filmed at TEDxCaltech.)</p>
