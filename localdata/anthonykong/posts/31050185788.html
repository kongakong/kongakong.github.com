<p>I am sharing an external harddisk connected to the Airport Extreme Base station. The shared storage will be used by three OSX machines as the time machine drive. So far so good.</p>

<p>My last-gen MBP has a 320Gb harddisk and about 265Gb of data. I am too lazy to do an initial time machine backup via a ethernet cable.</p>

<p>So over wifi and 10 hours later, the backup is still less than half way through.</p>

<p>I did not expect this scheme to work at all because my past research indicated that Apple/TimeMachine did not allow backup to network drive unless it is hosted by Time Capsule.</p>
