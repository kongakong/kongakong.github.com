<h2>Java vs Python (Prolog)</h2>
<p>If you are expecting some sort of combative comments in this post, you will be disappointed. </p>

<p>It all started a few days ago: I was asked by someone of extensive Java development background about the advantage of python, and if it is a suitable language for large scale. Despite I have been doing python application (web app) development for a few years, I found that my arguments did not come off very convincing. </p>

<p>So it gives me an idea to write a few, hopefully useful, pieces on this subject matter.</p>
