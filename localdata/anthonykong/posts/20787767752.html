<h2>Start reading "The Trial" by Kafka</h2>
<p>To be precise, I actually <i>started</i> reading the book some ten years ago.</p>

<p><br/>
I bought the book to read for a flight. However, I have never managed to finish it because I left the book on the plane! </p>

<p><br/>
Since then I have always wanted to finish the book. The first read was an engaging experience. Kafka&#8217;s story was surreal and yet very powerful to me. It just somehow captures some absurd essence of corporate work life.</p>

<p><br/>
However this time around the magic has waned a bit for me.</p>
