<p>Chapter 6, titled &#8216;The Far Eastern Anchor&#8217;, in ‘The Grand Chessboard’ (1997) by Zbigniew Brzezinski is about Asia. In regard to China, Zbigniew said:</p>

<p><em>&#8220;Chinese consumption of energy is already expanding at a rate that far exceeds domestic production. That excess will widen in any case, but especially so if China&#8217;s rate of growth continues to be very high.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>I am always impressed by how well scholars or researchers in the Stats have done in the study of China. Remember the Economists have predicted cruel oil price would hit $5 a barrel in 1999? This was apparently a prediction based on extrapolation of the then oil price movement. But a geo-strategist sees beyond short-run trends and tries to foresee how nations will engage each others to compete for finite resource on planet Earth.</p>

<p>Actually reading this book now I realise a fair numbers of predictions made in this chapter are not too far off the mark, e.g.</p>

<p>1) energy and food supply issue</p>

<p>2) when China will surpass Japan&#8217;s GDP (<em>&#8216;within two decades [from 1997]&#8217;</em>), and may rival that of USA</p>

<p>3) Tension between China and other Asian countries</p>
