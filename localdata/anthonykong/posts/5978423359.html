<h2>Item 19:  Differentiate among member functions, non-member functions, and friend functions</h2>
<p>Summary:</p>

<p><b>Virtual functions</b> must be members. If f needs to be virtual, make it a member function of C.</p>

<p>  <br/><b>operator&#187;</b> and <b>operator&#171;</b> are never members. If f is <b>operator&#187;</b> or <b> operator&#171;</b>, make f a non-member function. If, in addition, f needs access to non-public members of C, make f a friend of C. </p>

<p><br/>
Only non-member functions get type conversions on their left-most argument. If f needs type conversions on its left-most argument, make f a non-member function. If, in addition, f needs access to non-public members of C, make f a friend of C.  </p>

<p><br/>
Everything else should be a member function. If none of the other cases apply, make f a member function of C.</p>
