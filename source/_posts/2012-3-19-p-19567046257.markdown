The catch block is not reachable, because CFGetTypeID does not throw exception. It actually caused a EXC_BAD_ACCESS, which crashes the application.

```
    @try {
        CFGetTypeID(NULL);
    }  @catch   (NSException * e) {
            NSLog(@"Exception: %@", e);
    }
    @finally {
            NSLog(@"finally");
    }

```
