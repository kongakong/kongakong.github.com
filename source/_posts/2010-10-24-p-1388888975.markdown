Another weird problem with sync’ing ipad: When it comes to photo sync, it goes “You do not have enough access privileges to sync this ipad”.


It turns out because of previous share connection problem, I have changed the login for share mapping. The permissions are therefore out of sync.


Fixed by granting write permission to the group for the set of files
