From 'The Grand Chessboard' (1997) by Zbigniew Brzezinski,


> *The overseas British Empuire was initially acquired through a combination of exploration, trade, and conquest. But much like its Roman and Chinese predecessors or its French and Spanish rivals, it also derived a great deal of its staying power from the perception of British cultural superiority.*


‘Cultural superiority’ as the key to the staying power of an empire is the main theme in the book so far
