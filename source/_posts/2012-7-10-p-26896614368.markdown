From âThe Grand Chessboardâ (1997) by Zbigniew Brzezinski,


*“The overseas British Empire was initially acquired through a combination of exploration, trade, and conquest. But much like its Roman and Chinese predecessors or its French and Spanish rivals, it also derived a great deal of its staying power from the perception of British cultural superiority.”*


‘Cultural superiority’ as the key to the staying power of an empire is the main theme in the book so far
