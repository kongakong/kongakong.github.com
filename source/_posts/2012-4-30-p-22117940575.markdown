For some reason I do not understand I had a very old version of easy_install in /usr/local/bin which I use for brew binaries.


```


$ ls -l /usr/local/bin/easy_install
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  364 28 Feb  2009 /usr/local/bin/easy_install


```

The shebang of ``easy_install`` is sTILl pointing to a python 2.5 installation
