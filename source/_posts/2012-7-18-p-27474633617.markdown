In chapter 3 of âThe Grand Chessboardâ (1997), Zbigniew Brzezinski discusses the role of France and Germany in the EU, and predicted EU’s possible path of further eastward integration. If Ukraine is accepted into EU, a new European core will be formed: France + Germany + Poland + Ukraine.


You can see why Russia is so anxious about Ukraine.
