Encountered this error when adding core data support to my ios project

```
Receiver 'NSManagedObjectContext' for class message is a forward declaration.
```

Basically, in addition to adding the CoreData framework, we need to include the core data header file. The best place to add it is in the ``<AppName>-Prefix.pch``
