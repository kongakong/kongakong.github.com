From p63 of [the Design Pattern Slide](http://norvig.com/design-patterns/design-patterns.pdf) by Peter Norvig.

It sounds like a very good advise.


### Design Strategy: English Translation 

-  To insure that your program says what you mean: 

(1) Start with English description 

(2) Write code from description 

(3) Translate code back to English; compare to (1) 

Example: (1), (2) from a Lisp textbook 
(1) “Given a list of monsters, determine the number 
 that are swarms.” 

(2) See next slide 

(3) “Given a list of monsters, produce a 1 for a 
 monster whose type is swarm, and a 0 for others. 
 Then add up the numbers.”
