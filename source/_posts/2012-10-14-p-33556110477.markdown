Downloaded Scala IDE from TypeSafe. The simplest thing to test is to write a ‘Hello Word’ program. I did that by creating a Scala Object. Here is the code

{% codeblock lang:scala %}
package greeter

object helloworld {
    println("hello, world")
}

{% endcodeblock %}


I proceeded to run it by using the ‘Run it…’. I expected to see ‘Run as Scala Application’ but the option was not there.


Turns out it is my mistake. I need to extends the object from *App*:

{% codeblock lang:scala %}
package greeter

object helloworld extends App{
    println("hello, world")
}

{% endcodeblock %}



Then the option will appear (as shown here):
