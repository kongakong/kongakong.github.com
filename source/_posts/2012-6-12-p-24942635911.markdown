Finally figure out the back button title not set issue.


That’s what I have been doing in the originating controller’s ``prepareForSegue`` method:


It has not effect. The ``backBarButtonItem`` is probably not initialised yet. (Nothing will come out of a call to a nil object).


I should actually create an instance of the ``UIBarButtonItem``
