None


To enable the swipe to delete feature, one must implement this API:

I can enable this feature, but I got this exception from this function


It turns out even though I removed the object from the CoreDate managed context, I did not ask the NSFetchedResultsController to refetch the data set. The UITableView is still bound to the old data set and hence the internal inconsistency.
