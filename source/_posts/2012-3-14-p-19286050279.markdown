Quoted from ‘Winstonâs War: Churchill, 1940-1945â by Max Hastings:


The *Financial Times* columnist Lex wrote on June 23 [1941]: “Markets spent the morning trying to make up their minds whether the German aggression against Russia was a bull or a bear… The majority concluded that whatever happened we could hardly be worse off as a result of Hitler’s latest somersault.”
