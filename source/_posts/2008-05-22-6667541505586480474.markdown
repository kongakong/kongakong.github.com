I am officially a Mac convert.<br /><br />Still learning how to survive on one mouse button and use these fn, control, option and command keys. But so far so good. My MBP experience is absolutely positive.<br /><br />Before the purchase, I was slightly worried about if I may pay too much for a fine GUI. After last few days of hand-on experience, I think, as many MBP users has attested, the premium is well worth it.<br /><br />I, in particular, appreciate the BSD root of Mac OSX.  Whenever I cannot use the Mac OSX GUI to get thing done, I can always fall back to command line alternatives.<br /><br />Vista is a staggering failure of MS Corp in every sense (I have used Vista for a year). As Paul Graham puts it, Microsoft has <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/microsoft.html">ceased to be relevant</a>. They still have market share, but it is a market share going to erode fast, under the attacks of Sun, Linux and FOSS. The unwillingness to waste any more time on Vista is my prime motivation to switch.<br /><br />The very first application I have downloaded is the <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>. Basically within seconds I can start a new virtual instance of Ubuntu 8.04 beta. By default I can only <span style="font-weight: bold;">ssh</span> into the box via NAT. Will need to do some research to see how to get bridging done in Mac OSX.<br /><br />The second application I tried is, not surprisingly, <a href="http://www.blacktree.com/">QuickSliver</a>, an utility that warranted an hour of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4LkTstvUL4">Google Tech Talk</a>.
