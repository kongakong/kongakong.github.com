Use these APIs to set the iphone to vibrate


    AudioServicesPlayAlertSound(kSystemSoundID_Vibrate);
    AudioServicesPlaySystemSound(kSystemSoundID_Vibrate);


The first function plays a beep sound if the devices donâ€™t support vibration. The second function on the other hand does nothing on unsupported devices. 


if `AVRecorder` is running, iphone will not vibrate too.
