Health system of USA is odd. For example, Oregon uses a lottery based system to allocate health care coverage - a scarce resource - to its citizens.


From 

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Health_Plan](Wikipedia)


It  is basically saying that the policy makers have given up on trying to design and implement a system to allocate the resource based on any meaningful and measurable metrics.
