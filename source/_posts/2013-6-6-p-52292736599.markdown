Health system of USA is odd. For example, Oregon uses a lottery based system to allocate health care coverage - a scarce resource - to its citizens.


From 

[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Health_Plan)

> New enrollment in the program was closed from mid-2004 until early 
> 2008, when a lottery-based system was introduced. Tens of thousands 
> of Oregonians signed up, competing for 3,000 new spots in the plan.


It  is basically saying that the policy makers have given up on trying to design and implement a system to allocate the resource based on any meaningful and measurable metrics.
