Changed a controller to be a subclass of UITableViewController and got this


None


I skipped a few steps. After I did the following


1) Change the view class to UITableVIew


2) Connect the view to the ‘view’ slot of the Controller


3) Connect the view’s datasource and delegate to the Controller.


the runtime exception is gone.
