Just feel that python is easier for XML manipulation.


e.g.

{% codeblock lang:python %}
from lxml import etree
f = open("digg-science-rss1.xml")
tree  = etree.parse(f)
tree.xpath(expr) 
{% endcodeblock %}



Very concise.


whereas in erlang, since the function xmerl:string may return a list thatâ€™s composed of various record type (such as  xmlRecord or xmlText etc), it makes the handling more complex (one clause per record type). The printout from REPL is also a lot more verbose. e.g.

```
...
      #xmlText{
          parents = [{item,16},{channel,2},{rss,1}],
          pos = 3,language = [],value = "\n   ",type = text},
      #xmlElement{
          name = link,expanded_name = link,nsinfo = [],
          namespace = 
              #xmlNamespace{
                  default = [],
                  nodes =
...
```
