Objective-c/Apple platform is my new adventure.


Step 0 is acquisition of a Apple machine.


Step 1, obviously, is to get familiar with the IDE, Xcode.


Step 2? I would say it is to be effective in searching and reading the documentation.


That’s how NSLog becomes the title of the post: how could I find out all I need to know about the ‘format’ parameter efficiently?
