By happenstance I picked up the book "<a type="amzn" asin="0071416641">Using the Wall Street Journal</a>" (5th Ed.) by Michael B. Lehmann. This book has been sitting idly on my bookshelves, gathering dust, for a very, very long time.<br /><br />On p. 99, there is a reprint of a news story published on 30, Jan 1995. In which it reported,<br /><br /><blockquote style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Greenspan Defends Moves</span><br /><br />The Fed has been criticised for raising interest rates before seeing any evidence of worsening inflation, but Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan replied in remarks prepared for delivery over the weekend: "If we have waited until inflation had become evident, it would have been too late."</blockquote><br />A lot has been changed since then.
