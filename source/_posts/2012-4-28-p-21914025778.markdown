Followup piece of [GNU gcc-4.2 issue on OSX 10.7](/blog/2012/04/26/p-21844435707/). So I downloaded a gcc package from [ this location](https://github.com/kennethreitz/osx-gcc-installer). Then run this command

```
installer -pkg GCC-10.7.pkg -target /
```
Problem solved. Now I can compile python3. For example,
```
CC=gcc-4.2 ./configure
make && make install
```
