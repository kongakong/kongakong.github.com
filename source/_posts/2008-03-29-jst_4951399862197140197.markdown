If investment is as simple as just buying something for income, then compound interest should be suffice for this purpose. For example, if the Medici family had set aside $100,000 in a fund for 5% compound interest return, its 1933 value will be a staggering $517,000,000,000,000,000!<br /><br />But there are a lot of threat to the preservation of capital: war, political change, new technical breakthrough, to name a few. As a result, only a handful of poeple can turn a profit from investment. Actually, for those who lost a portion of their purchasing power, they have done a lot better than most in the market.<br /><br />Therefore , the author urged the readers to set a <span style="font-style: italic;">very high</span> goal in their investment. The investors should aim at return so high such that it can cover the average loss sustained in the overall investment activities. The loss can be a consequence of, for example, poor investment decision, the effects of exchange rate changes, and unexpected closing position due to change in circumstances etc.<br /><br /><br /><br /><span><span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-style: italic;"> Quick link to </span><a style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;" type="amzn" asin="0471132977">The Battle for Investment Survival</a><span style="font-style: italic;"> by Gerald M.
