Sometimes it is quite fun to answer some questions in Stackoverflow: you can help someone seeking answer and you may also learn a new thing or two yourself in the process.


This is one such example: 

[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11707151/python-make-a-global-condition-break.](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11707151/python-make-a-global-condition-break.)


Essentially the OP is asking if there is an easy to find the number of occurrence of a substring in a longer string. For example “assesses” has the substring “sses” 2 times.


It is a very simple question, but there is still something new I learn: while  


My proposed solution is simply an improved version of OP’s code.
