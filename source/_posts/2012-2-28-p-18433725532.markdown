“The fathers of Andrew Jackson, 7th President of the USA; Rutherford B Hayes, 19th President of the USA; and Bill Clinton, 42nd President of the USA, all died before their sons were born.”





Source: QI quote of the day




It just reminded me about an interesting theory on what kind of man will get into politic: those with fathers who are already active in powerful in politics and those who don’t have a father at all. 




The formers have all the connections and network built out for them, so it is easy for them to climb the ladder in the political system.




The latter struggle to acquire a father figure in their lives. They will form a strong bond and attachment to their mentors in the political party they belong. The loyalty will help to propel them to prominent positions within the hierarchy.
