Installing pyML by running ```python setup.py install```


But I do not think it is going to fly because, for example,


``````


/usr/bin/llvm-gcc -fno-strict-aliasing -O3 -w -pipe -march=core2 -msse4 -DNDEBUG -g -fwrapv -O3 -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -I/usr/local/bin/../Cellar/python/2.7.2/include/python2.7 -c PyML/containers/ext/Kernel.cpp -o build/temp.macosx-10.4-x86_64-2.7/PyML/containers/ext/Kernel.o


It is using llvm-gcc instead of gcc-4.2 (the GUN compiler)
