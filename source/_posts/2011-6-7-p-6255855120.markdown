Seems like I have polluted my python installation a little bit. There are two python2.6

```

mbp002:cpython $ md5sum /usr/bin/python
e3a892c8511d5086b485aeb7e9700672  /usr/bin/python
mbp002:cpython $ md5sum /opt/local/bin/python
defb6eacf7bf552bef7c4033e685ec13  /opt/local/bin/python



mbp002:cpython $ otool -L /usr/bin/python
/usr/bin/python:
	/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreFoundation.framework/Versions/A/CoreFoundation (compatibility version 150.0.0, current version 550.29.0)
	/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 125.2.0)
mbp002:cpython $ otool -L /opt/local/bin/python
/opt/local/bin/python:
	/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 125.2.0)
