There are three technique to make a header file more self-contained:


1. ``Avoid using objects when object references and pointers will do``


This will avoid the need of including a header file


2. ``Don't _#include_ header files in your header files unless your headers won't compile without them`` 


Use forward declaration instead


Probably useful technique if the scale of the c++ project warrants it?
