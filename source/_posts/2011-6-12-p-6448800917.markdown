There are three technique to make a header file more self-contained:


1. ```
Avoid using objects when object references and pointers will do
```


This will avoid the need of including a header file


2. ```
Don't _#include_ header files in your header files unless your headers won't compile without them
``` 


Use forward declaration instead
