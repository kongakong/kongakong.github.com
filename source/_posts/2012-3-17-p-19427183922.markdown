Getting this:  “Couldn’t register com.abc.MyApp with the bootstrap server. Error: unknown error code.” when trying to run a unit test in AppCode.


The underlying Xcode version is 4.3.1


The only way to resolve it is restarting the computer.


I cannot even get magsafe to work. The magsafe is connected to the connector, but the battery icon is showing: “Not charging”. Something is a very wrong at the kenrel level.
