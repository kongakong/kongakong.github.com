After some trial and errors, the best way (as of this writing) to manage cookbooks for **vagrant** + **chef** is to use brekshef. You can forget about `knife` or `librarian-chef`.

If you use berkshelf with vagrant, you will need to install the vagrant-berkshelf plugin. The plugin is quite clever and you do not need to specify the cookbook path for your chef-solo or chef-zero provisioner. 

However it does not apply to `data_bags`. You will still need to specify the path to `data_bags` if you need to use data bag.
