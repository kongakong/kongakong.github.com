Added a UITableVIew to my custom controller. Now I want to be able to add a segway to a cell in this table view.




Since I did not start with a UITableViewController at the beginning, I was unable to connect a segway to an individual cell inside the table view. 




Finally, by trial and error, I dragged a ‘Table View Cell’ object onto the UITableView. It is now displayed as ‘Prototype Cells’




I can create an outgoing segway from this prototype cell. But now I am getting this error message





It can be easily fixed by simply filling in the *Identifier* field in the *Attribute inspector*.
