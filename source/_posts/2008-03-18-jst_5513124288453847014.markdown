The recent market turmoil makes me reflect on the time-tested investment wisdom as laid out in the book “The Battle for Investment Survival” by Gerald M. Loeb.

Absolutely old fashion money advise. But for someone like me who is not a professional trader and has limited appetite for risk, these advises are actually very practical. The underlying principles are sound and easy to understand.

I am going to write a few blogs on a few chapters of this book. First of all, they will serve as a kind of “note to self” for me. Hopefully they might make you interested in this book too.
