Loeb.</span><br /><br />Absolutely old fashion money advise. But for someone like me who is not a full time trader and has limited appetite for risk, these advises are actually very practical. The underlying principles are sound and easy to understand.<br /><br />Therefore, I want to spend next few blog to write a sort of "reading report" on a few chapters of this book, such that, first of all, serves as a "note to myself", and hopefully make you interested in this book too.
