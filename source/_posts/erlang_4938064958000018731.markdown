I would hardly use the "success stories" as the authoritative list of companies that use Python.<BR/><BR/>I'm the CTO of a large hedge fund and our development platform is primarily Python. And while we are by no means a large firm (in terms of head count), I have been seeing more and more resumes in the finance world of people using Python at large financial firms.<BR/><BR/>As Python is not a "mainstream" language, I think it comes in the back door at organizations so you won't always see it in job postings or other public references. That doesn't mean it's not used.
