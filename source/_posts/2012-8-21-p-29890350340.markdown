[http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/006135323X/]( ‘Predictably Irrational’ )


I have heard many of his talks so I already have some good idea what his book is about. But it still makes a very interesting read.


First couple of chapters are about price anchoring.


I suppose we can use it as a socio-psychological groundwork to explain why we have frequent financial crises.


Okay, each financial crisis involves different markets and instruments. Each of them has unique background,  fundamentals and built-up. However, it always take a crisis-scale event for the underlying structural problem to be exposed and unwired itself. A crisis serves as a publicised event to readjust everyone’s anchoring of the value and returns of the financial assets that are under distress.
