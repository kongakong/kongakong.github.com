Spent an hour to check why my *viewDidLoad()* method was not called.


Breakpoints, debugger, documentation, online forum and whatnot were tried but of no avail.


It turned out I have overridden the wrong method: I have overridden the *viewDidUnload()* instead. Very obviously I removed the wrong part of code template that were generated by Xcode during project creation.


Epic fail.
