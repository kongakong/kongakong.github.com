Tried to build _python_ in _Solaris Express 11_.

Used ```
pkg
``` to install the ```
gcc/g++

and ```
hg
```. 

Ran ```
configure
``` to generate the ```
Makefile
```.

After hitting ```
make
```, got this error message:

```

math.h no such file or directory 

```

Solved by running: ```
pkg install header-math
