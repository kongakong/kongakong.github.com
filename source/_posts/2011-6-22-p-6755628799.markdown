Tried to build *python* in *Solaris Express 11*.

Used ```pkg``` to install the ```gcc/g++```. 

and ```hg```. 

Ran ```configure``` to generate the ```Makefile```.

After hitting ```make```, got this error message:

```
math.h no such file or directory 
```

Solved by running: ```pkg install header-math```
