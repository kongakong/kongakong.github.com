Turns out the modems have issue with TPG, and the problem can only be fixed by refreshing the firmware. But when I discovered it, I have already spent hours to isolate the problem.


Most people reports instant “plug-and-play” experience. It is probably because the currently available retail units are of more recent version and already have the firmware sorted out. Not my case. I ordered the modem online.
