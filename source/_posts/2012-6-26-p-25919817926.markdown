Had ```
"Error: No developer directory found at /Developer. Run /usr/bin/xcode-select to update the developer directory path"
``` when I ran ```
xcodebuild
```.


Most likely an issue left from an old xcode installation (pre 4.2)


The following command fix the problem


```
sudo xcode-select -switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
```
