Wrote up a simple test module code (simply called ‘test’), inside which I defined a function ```mp```. It does some loan calculation given a loan amount, interest rate (*r*) and repayment periods (*n*).


When I compile the module, I get this error message:


```Warning: this expression will fail with a 'badarith' exception```


Not really understand what is wrong, I proceed to run the code like so: ```test:mp(100000, 0.075/12.0, 30*12)```.


Now I get another error message:


```


Turns out the function declaration is ```mp(B, r, n) ```.


See the problem there? ```r``` and ```n``` are atoms! I forgot to use uppercase to denote they are actually input variables.
