The solaris installation issue I had is related to the kind of VM I have chosen in VBox. I have used normal Solaris instead of *Solaris 64bit*


After changing the VM type, the installation is done reasonably fast.


To install the guest addition, run


``pkgadd -d pkgadd -d <path/to/the/pkg file>``
