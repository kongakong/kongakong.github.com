Just found an old receipt for 4 GB RAM I purchased on 12 Aug 2009. It was for my last Mac Book Pro (pre-unibody model). It costed me A$220.


And about a week, I spent less than this amount and got myself 16G RAM to upgrade my iMac.


OK, they are of different form factor, but I sTILl do not expect this price differential.
