The UITableViewController does not ‘live’ in a UINavigationController


None


Because I am using storyboard, the solution is slightly different from non-storyboard project.


Original structure is that a TabBarController owns two custom controllers. The first controller is a subclass of a UITableViewController.


To fix the problem, I have to 


1) drag a UINavigationController in between the TabBarController and the First Custom Controller.


2) Remove the original ‘relationship’ segue between TabBarController and the First Custom Controller


3) Add a relationship between the TabBarController and the new UINavigationController


4) Add a relationship between the new UINavigationController and the new First Custom Controller
