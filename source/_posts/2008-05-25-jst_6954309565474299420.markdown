As an investor it is important to do proper accounting to keep track of  the P/L of his/her holdings. Ideally the holding should be marked to market frequently if not monthly. All cost and income should be recorded. It helps an investor to have a realistic picture of the health of  his/her investment.<br /><br />An investor should also maintain a reserve account which sets aside cash for tax on realised and unrealised profit.<br /><br />The book was first written in 1936, so, I reckon, it did require work and discipline for average do-it-yourself investors to keep track of P/L back in those days. Today, with all these online resources such as Yahoo Finance, it is a lot easier to do so. <br /> <br /><br />Quick link to <a style="font-style: italic;" type="amzn" asin="0471132977">The Battle for Investment Survival</a>  by Gerald M.
