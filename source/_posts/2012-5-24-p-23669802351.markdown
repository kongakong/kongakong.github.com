Just finished the podcast series (total to 6.7 hours). The story of Byzantine Empire is amazing. Lars has kept very good pace in the narrative. The materials are not too light or too dense. 


Absolutely a great introduction to Byzantine history for someone who knows next to nothing about this splendid empire.
