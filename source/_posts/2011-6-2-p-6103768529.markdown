Message after a successful installation

```

If this is your first install, automatically load on login with:
    mkdir -p ~/Library/LaunchAgents
    cp /usr/local/Cellar/couchdb/1.0.2/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.couchdb.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
    launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/org.apache.couchdb.plist

If this is an upgrade and you already have the org.apache.couchdb.plist loaded:
    launchctl unload -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/org.apache.couchdb.plist
    cp /usr/local/Cellar/couchdb/1.0.2/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.couchdb.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
    launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/org.apache.couchdb.plist

Or start manually with:
    couchdb

```
