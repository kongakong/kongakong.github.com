If you are expecting some sort of combative comments in this post, you will be disappointed. 


It all started a few days ago: I was asked by someone of extensive Java development background about the advantage of python, and if it is a suitable language for large scale. Despite I have been doing python application (web app) development for a few years, I found that my arguments did not come off very convincing. 


So it gives me an idea to write a few, hopefully useful, pieces on this subject matter.
