Last warning.

```

wx             : wxWidgets not found, wx will NOT be usable
```

Probably no existing rpm for this. 

These yum commands fixed most of the warnings

```
yum install ncurses
yum install ncurses-devel
yum install java-1.6.0-openjdk
yum install libssh2-devel 
yum install openssl-devel
yum install java-1.6.0-openjdk-devel
yum install unixODBC
yum install unixODBC-devel
```
