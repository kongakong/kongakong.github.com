Quote from Hong Kong Economic Journal:

   證明泡沫在一片悲觀中膨脹，在一片樂觀中爆破
   泡沫結束期股市將十分寧靜，鰠進入寧靜期之前則必然有多次反彈，叫做牛陷阱（Bull traps）
   狂牛往往粛極度熱鬧時死亡，而巨熊死前則好寧靜。


Translation:

    It proves that a Bubble forms amid permissim, and busts when optimism finally prevails.

    When a Bubble is near its end, the stock market becomes very quiet. But before entering the period of tranquillity, there are a lot of rebounce. It is known as the Bull Traps.

    The raging bull dies when there is an extreme exuberance, whereas the giant bear's death preceded by quietness.
