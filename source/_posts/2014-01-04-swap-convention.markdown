>     Fixed-rate payer: pay a fixed rate of 5.25 percent
>                       receive 6-month LIBOR
>In this example, the bank is quoting an offer rate of 5.25 percent, which is what the fixed-rate payer will pay, and a bid rate of 5.19 percent, which is what the floating-rate payer will receive. The bid-offer spread is therefore 6 basis points.
