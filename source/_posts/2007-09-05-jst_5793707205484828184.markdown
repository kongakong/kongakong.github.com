Recession is now being discussed again.<br /><br />I vaguely remembered that there was an academic study of the correlation between number of published news articles and the occurrence of recession. I believe the conclusion is  that the article numbers is probably a good leading indicator to a looming recession.<br /><br />Todays, can we use the blogsphere as a data source? A quick Google search gave the following result:<br /><table border="1"><br /><tbody><tr><th><br />Year</th><th>Count</th><br /></tr></tbody><tbody><br /><br /><tr><td>'07 </td><td>133,933</td></tr><br /><tr><td>'06</td><td> 66942</td></tr><br /><tr><td>'05</td><td> 19049</td></tr><br /></tbody></table><br /><br />It is a very rough sketch. It did not take into account the blog entries that existed during the surveyed time period. It did not check the context either.<br /><br />But if blogshpere serves as a place for collective rumbling, maybe there are messages to be mined out of it.
