First of all, you have to install python3.3 on your platform. In Ubuntu 12.10, I use apt-get to install python3.3. (By default it comes with python3.2, which does not have built-in virtual env support)


Then youâ€™ll need to create a virtualenv and activate it. For details see 

[the python doc](http://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)


Since I want to install packages using pip, I proceed to install distribute.
