When everything is cooked, throw them all together in a pan, mix, and serve

* Boil the pasta for the appropriate amount of time
* Cut the broccoli and throw in into a steam pot until it looks all pretty and green
* Boil the prepared shrimp for the appropriate amount of time (and until they look all pretty and orange), or you can simply thaw frozen cooked shrimp
* Prepare pesto by throwing it into a small saucepan with some milk and butter, added some garlic powder and Parmesan cheese
