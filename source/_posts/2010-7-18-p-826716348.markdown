As a newcomer on the iOS platform, it really takes a while to understand the support of the OpenGL ES standard on the iPhone/iPad platform.


According to 

[http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/documentation/3DDrawing/Conceptual/OpenGLES_ProgrammingGuide/OpenGLESontheiPhone/OpenGLESontheiPhone.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008793-CH101-SW1](the Apple doc)


I suppose it means both ES 1.1 and 2.0 are supported by iPhone and iPad.
