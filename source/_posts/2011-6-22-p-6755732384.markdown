The _python_ build on _solaris express_ is a partial success. Here is part of the output message:

```

Python build finished, but the necessary bits to build these modules were not found:
_gdbm              ossaudiodev                        
To find the necessary bits, look in setup.py in detect_modules() for the module's name.


Failed to build these modules:
_curses            _curses_panel                      



```
