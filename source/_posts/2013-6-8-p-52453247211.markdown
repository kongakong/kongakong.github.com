When I create a new tab in Terminal, the new bash shell does not automatically execute the .bashrc file. As a result my brew environmet is not setup propertly.

To solve it, I added this to my .bash_profile to fix the problem:

```

[[ -s ~/.bashrc ]] && source ~/.bashrc

```

``-s`` here means if the file exists and not of size 0
