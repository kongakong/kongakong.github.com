None


In chapter 4 of âThe Grand Chessboardâ (1997), Zbigniew Brzezinski discusses the void of power in the former Soviet territory after the collapse of USSR. The material and analysis is very dated. For one, President Yeltsin was still in power when this chapter is written. Current Russian administration bears little resemblance to Yeltsin’s government.


A lot of subjective wishes as to what Russian should do or not.
