I am using Aquamacs Emacs which is built on emacs 23.3.50.1.

When I tried to indent a block of python code using the menu item 'Python' -> 'Shift Region Right', I got this error message ``Symbol's function defintion is void: py-shit-right``

So instead of using the menu option, I just use ``C-c >`` to take care of it.
