None


The duration formula reduces the bond in question down to a zero coupon bond equivalent. The result is measured in years. A 7% 30-year bond with a 7.2-year duration is expected to have the same volatility as a zero coupon bond maturing in 7.2 years. 


Furthermore, the price is expected to change roughly 7.2% when interest rates change 100 bp.
