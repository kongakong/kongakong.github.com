Revisiting [Item 23: Don't Try to Return a Reference When You Must Return an Object](/blog/2011/06/04/p-6172106672)



While the title sounds rather generic, the main content is about what is appropriate to return from various operator functions.




SO has a more 

[in-depth treatment](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4421706/operator-overloading/4421729)



In the case of binary operators, here is a good example of the function declaration/implementation:

{% codeblock lang:c++ %}
class X { 
  X& operator+=(const X& rhs) 
  {
    // actual addition of rhs to *this 
    return *this;
  }
}; 
inline X operator+(X lhs, const X& rhs)
{
  lhs += rhs;
  return lhs;
} 
}; 
{% endcodeblock %}

Note the parameter lhs is passed into ``operator+`` via copying.
