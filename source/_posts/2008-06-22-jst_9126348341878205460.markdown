In this interview, Professor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Chu">Steven Chu</a> has mentioned how important that modern equipment has allowed him to "see" and hence led to new discovery physics.<br /><br /><object height="344" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/y-7gWsoXtUw"><param name="wmode" value="transparent"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/y-7gWsoXtUw" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" height="344" width="425"></embed></object><br /><br />A similar theme was also covered by Benoit Mandelbrot in one of his interview, which unfortunately I cannot locate the relevant resource now. In the interview he said his development of factual theory is in part made possible due to advance in computer graphic.<br /><br />Recent advance in Cognitive Psychology are in no small part brought along by the use of fMRI on human brain.<br /><br />This is why the developed world has such an advantage in science R&amp;D. Having new mean to see and explore new dimension in the world around us is instrumental to new scientific discovery. Few developing countries have both the financial strength and human capital to build this capability. Thinks: how many nations on earth has atomic accelerators?
