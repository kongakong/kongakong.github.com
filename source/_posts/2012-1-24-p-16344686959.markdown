It means I am missing the elib library. 




However according to 

[http://www.gnu.org/software/elib/](GNU)



It turns out it is because the default emacs in OSX is of version 22. Any version less than 23 will try to invoke the old ```
avltree
``` in elib.




Use brew to install the latest version of emacs
