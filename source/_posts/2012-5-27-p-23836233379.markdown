This code fragment
```

// item is a MPMediaItem
NSURL url = [item valueForProperty:MPMediaItemPropertyAssetURL];

```

causes ```
Interface type cannot be statically allocated 
```

But xcode is smart enough to show a tip right away on how to fix it. Just need to change ```
NSURL
``` to ```
NSURL*
```
