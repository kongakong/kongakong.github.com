Another difference between Linux and OSX: no more *adduser*>. Use *dscl*> instead.


So, for example, in order to find out what groups are defined locally, we can run


```dscl  localhost -list /Local/Default/Groups```


To add someone to a group, we should run


```dscl . append /Groups/somegroup GroupMembership someuser```


Don't know where ```GroupMembership``` comes from. From documentation?
