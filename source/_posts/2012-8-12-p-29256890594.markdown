A way to dismiss a modal view controller is to link the button to an ``IBAction`` like this:

{% codeblock lang:objc %}
- (IBAction)cancelAddItem:(UIBarButtonItem *)sender {
    [self.navigationController popViewControllerAnimated:YES];
}
{% endcodeblock %}

But it does not work in storyboard anymore.


This is the solution:

{% codeblock  lang:objc %}
- (IBAction)cancelAddItem:(UIBarButtonItem *)sender {
    [self dismissModalViewControllerAnimated:YES];
}

{% endcodeblock %}
