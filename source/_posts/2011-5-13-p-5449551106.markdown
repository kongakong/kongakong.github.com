Taken from [Lecture 2](http://www.cs.caltech.edu/courses/cs11/material/erlang/lectures/cs11-erl-lec2.pdf)


`` math`` module contains a ``sqrt`` function, but 
can't pass it as an argument.  Module functions aren't higher-order function.


Instead, we can wrap it with a `fun`:

    1> lists:map(fun math:sqrt/1, [9, 16, 25]). 
    [3.00000,4.00000,5.00000]
