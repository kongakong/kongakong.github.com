An old project was created for iOS 5. When trying to re-run it, I got these error messages


Do not recall this kind of trouble before with iOS upgrade.


Set the ‘Deployment Target’ to iOS6, clean and rebuilt but it did not work.


AVFoundation Framework is actually dropped out from “Link Binary with Libraries” section. Re-adding the framework fixes the issue.
