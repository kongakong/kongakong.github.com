From 'The Grand Chessboard' (1997) by Zbigniew Brzezinski,

> *Never before has a populist democracy attained international supremacy. But the pursuit of power is not a goal that commands popular passion, except in conditions of a sudden threat or challenge to the public's sense of domestic well-being. The economic self-denial (that is, defense spending) and the human sacrifice (casualties even among professional soldiers) required in the effort are uncongenial to democratic instincts. Democracy is inimical to imperial mobilization.*


Democractic vales are inherently contradictory to empire buildingâ€¦
