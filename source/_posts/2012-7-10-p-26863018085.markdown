From âThe Grand Chessboardâ (1997) by Zbigniew Brzezinski


*“Even so, the Roman Empire was not unique. The Roman and the Chinese empires emerged almost contemporaneously, though neither was aware of the other.”*


It is not entirely true. There are mentioning of a big empire in the far west named ‘Great Qin’ (å¤§ç§¦) in ancient official documentation e.g. the Book of Late Han. But the majority of populace probably did not know it.
