Come across this useful  [post on reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/z16ap/switch_to_mac_for_python_programming/c60vbly)


Summary:

* use ``homebrew`` for installing/managing mysql/nginx/apache/etc - but not Python!
* use ``pythonbrew`` for managing your Python installs.
* use ``buildout`` in place of virtualenv. Trust me on this. You will thank me later.
* use ``supervisor`` to run any dev-based daemons (nginx/mysql/mongodb/etc).


A main problem I had before is building scipy. Hopefully pythonbrew might fix this issue.
