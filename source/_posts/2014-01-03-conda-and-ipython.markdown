It is a follow-up on [my last ipython install issue](/post/2013/12/30/conda-install-ipython-problem/) 

Turn out i just need to follow the suggested solution in the conda failure message, which is to use ``-p /path/to/local/conda``

Now I have four set of python runtime installed on my MBP:

* From Apple

* From Homebrew

* From Pythonbrew

* From conda
