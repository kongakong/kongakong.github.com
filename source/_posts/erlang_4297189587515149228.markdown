There are many paradox in software.<br /><br />The first paradox I can think of is the misconception of "ease of use".<br /><br />Some technology, on first glance, very easy to use. Two mouse clicks and one "Ctrl-S", the outcome is saved into a file and job is done.<br /><br />However, it is <span style="font-style: italic;">hard </span>actually.<br /><br />I am not a Zen master. Please let me explain.<br /><br />As in any statement, the meaning depends on the context and situation.<br /><br />In a sense point-and-click  help you<br /><br />
