Encountered 




when trying to install the ```
Guest Additions
``` into the Fedora 15 VM instance in VirtualBox.





As part of the error message, it clearly indicated which package (a kernel-devel package)  needs to be installed.




Then it reports the gcc is not found. ```
 yum install gcc g++
``` seems to take care of this problem.




Take a few reboot and reinstallation to get it right




But Fedora is not working 100% in this VM environment. Sometimes part of the screen turns blue for no reason or when mouseover
