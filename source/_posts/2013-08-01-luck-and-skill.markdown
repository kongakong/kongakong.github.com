> For almost two centuries, Spain has hosted an enormously popular Christmas lottery. Based on 
> payout, it is the biggest lottery in the world and nearly all Spaniards play. In the mid 1970s, a man 
> sought a ticket with the last two digits ending in 48. He found a ticket, bought it, and then won the 
> lottery. When asked why he was so intent on finding that number, he replied, "I dreamed of the 
> number seven for seven straight nights. And 7 times 7 is 48."
