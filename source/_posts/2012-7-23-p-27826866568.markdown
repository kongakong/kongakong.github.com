Chapter 6, titled ‘The Far Eastern Anchor’, in âThe Grand Chessboardâ (1997) by Zbigniew Brzezinski is about Asia. In regard to China, Zbigniew said:


*“Chinese consumption of energy is already expanding at a rate that far exceeds domestic production. That excess will widen in any case, but especially so if China’s rate of growth continues to be very high.”*


I am always impressed by how well scholars or researchers in the Stats have done in the study of China. Remember the Economists have predicted cruel oil price would hit $5 a barrel in 1999? This was apparently a prediction based on extrapolation of the then oil price movement. But a geo-strategist sees beyond short-run trends and tries to foresee how nations will engage each others to compete for finite resource on planet Earth.


Actually reading this book now I realise a fair numbers of predictions made in this chapter are not too far off the mark, e.g.


1) energy and food supply issue


2) when China will surpass Japan’s GDP (*‘within two decades [from 1997]’*), and may rival that of USA


3) Tension between China and other Asian countries
