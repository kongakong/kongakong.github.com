    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/006135323X/"> ‘Predictably Irrational’ </a>.</p>

<p>I have heard many of his talks so I already have some good idea what his book is about. But it still makes a very interesting read.</p>

<p>First couple of chapters are about price anchoring.</p>

<p>I suppose we can use it as a socio-psychological groundwork to explain why we have frequent financial crises.</p>

<p>Each financial crisis involves different markets and instruments. Each of them has unique background,  fundamentals and built-up. However, it always take a crisis-scale event for the underlying structural problem to be exposed and unwind itself. A crisis serves as a publicised event to readjust everyone’s anchoring of the value and returns of the financial assets that are under distress.</p>
