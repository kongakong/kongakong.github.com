<p>Source: QI quote of the day</p>

<p>It just reminded me about an interesting theory on what kind of man will get into politic: those with fathers who are already active in powerful in politics and those who don’t have a father at all.</p>

<p>The formers have all the connections and network built out for them, so it is easy for them to climb the ladder in the political system.</p>

<p>The latter struggle to acquire a father figure in their lives. They will form a strong bond and attachment to their mentors in the political party they belong. The loyalty will help to propel them to prominent positions within the hierarchy.</p>
