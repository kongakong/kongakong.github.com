			Erlang Mailing List - String as List 1</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A discussion named &ldquo;String as List&rdquo; has been running, at the time of writing, for 6 days and 56 posts already. A lot of interesting idea and insight into Erlang were poured into this discussion. I simply want to write down some interesting technical points in this blog as a digest, as a reference. <em><br /><br />It all started with a question from <span class="HcCDpe"><span email="tsuraan@gmail.com" class="EP8xU" style="color: rgb(0, 104, 28);">tsuraan</span>:<br /><br /></span><blockquote style="font-style: italic;">&ldquo;Why does erlang internally represent strings as lists?&rdquo;</blockquote><br />First response from <span class="HcCDpe"><span email="masklinn@masklinn.net" class="EP8xU" style="color: rgb(121, 6, 25);">Masklinn</span><span class="lDACoc">, and actually many other contributors share the same idea:<br /></span></span><blockquote style="font-style: italic;"><span class="HcCDpe"><span class="lDACoc"><br /></span></span>&ldquo;A lot of functional languages represent strings as lists rather than<br />arrays because lists are their basic collection datatype, and this allows the use of all the list-related functions on strings.&rdquo;</blockquote><br /><span class="HcCDpe"><span email="chsu79@gmail.com" class="EP8xU" style="color: rgb(91, 16, 148);">Christian S </span> put it in a shorter phrase: &ldquo;historical reason&rdquo;. As he pointed out, &ldquo;internal&rdquo; is not right word in the question because string was not a special type or abstraction built on top of list. A string is a list.<br /><br />He then suggested the following module for handling large text:<br /></span><br /><blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">&ldquo;&ndash; binaries (features representation that is 1:1 with the character</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">encoding itself, now also (R12B) with efficient scanning and</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">tail-construction)</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">&ndash; iolists (features cheap concatenation of large texts)</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">&ndash; list of words and a word-dictionary (features quicker scanning of words, efficient storage too)&rdquo;</span><span class="HcCDpe"><br /></span></blockquote><span class="HcCDpe"><span class="lDACoc">Then </span></span><span class="HcCDpe"><span email="kevin@scaldeferri.com" class="EP8xU" style="color: rgb(204, 0, 96);">Kevin Scaldeferri </span></span><span class="HcCDpe"><span class="lDACoc">throws in a different point: list is not a good representation because<br /><br /></span></span><blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;" class="HcCDpe"><span class="lDACoc">&ldquo;</span></span><span style="font-style: italic;">First off, I append to strings a lot more than I prepend to them.  Yeah, I</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;"> could work with reversed strings, but that&rsquo;s a hack to deal with using the </span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">wrong data type.  Plus, I probably prefix match more often than suffix matching</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">(although this is less lopsided than append vs. prepend) &hellip;&rdquo;</span><br /></blockquote><br />Now we have a diversion, <span class="HcCDpe"><span email="vlm@lionet.info" class="EP8xU" style="color: rgb(0, 131, 145);">Lev Walkin </span></span>responded to earlier Robert&rsquo;s post about that list is an ideal string representation because it can easily accommodate UTF-16 and UTF-32.<br /><br /><blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">&ldquo;Small correction: UTF-16 and UTF-32 are practically dead, you certainly</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">need to think in terms of UTF-8 nowadays.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><br /></blockquote><span class="HcCDpe">Now we are going to have several threads going on under the same thread subject. Let&rsquo;s get to it in my next blog. But for now I will ignore UTF-8 vs UTF16/32 discussions in order to focus on Erlang features.<br /><br />End of Part 1<br /><span class="lDACoc"></span></span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;"></em> It is about summarization, so quote will be edited liberally for clarity, rather than reproduced word for word.<br /></span></p>

			Oversocialnetworkisation</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>When I write this blog, I fully expect this information, given the exponential growing digital archive storage, will be kept for prosperity eternally.<br /><br />As long as we can capture all these information in digital form of which, I can assure you, this tiny article is already in, then you, my dear reader, will always be capable of reaching this article, as long as you are so determined to know something about me.<br /><br />The problem is: now since we remember so well, we are losing the ability to <span style="font-style: italic;">forgive and forget</span>.<br /><br />For example, some people made mistakes. Some people made mistakes occasionally, some people made mistakes all too often. We probably do not want to give forgiveness to perpetual liers, but we also should not dwell on one&rsquo;s bad move, which could be a result of poor judgment or simply circumstantial.<br /><br />But today, every records are digitized. We can crosschecked records in A against records in B. Past stories no longer faded into oblivion with time.<br /><br />As if they are trapped in a perpetual time capsule whose accessibility,  paradoxically, is just a mouse click away.<br /><br />A new generation of offenders now are the all-reaching social networks. It expands, it keeps tracks, it feeds on your personal information. Your misdeeds, once made public, by your own hands or not, will be instantly available to the World, and can never be retracted.<br /><br />Your friend and your acquaintance will  never forget too.<br /><br />Those who watched will remember, those who had not will attempt to find out, those forgot can search to refresh the memory.<br /><br />How will this impact human collective EQ is yet to be seen.<br /><br />But I am glad this gives me a legitimate excuse to create a new word: <span style="font-style: italic;">Oversocialnetworkisation</span>.<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">(The only worry is: the above &ldquo;manifesto&rdquo; makes me sound a bit like the </span><a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Kaczynski">Unibomder</a><span style="font-style: italic;">&hellip;)<br /><br /></span></p>

			Paradox in Software I</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There are many paradox in software.<br /><br />The first paradox I can think of is the misconception of &ldquo;ease of use&rdquo;.<br /><br />Some technology, on first glance, very easy to use. Two mouse clicks and one &ldquo;Ctrl-S&rdquo;, the outcome is saved into a file and job is done.<br /><br />However, it is <span style="font-style: italic;">hard </span>actually.<br /><br />I am not a Zen master. Please let me explain.<br /><br />As in any statement, the meaning depends on the context and situation.<br /><br />In a sense point-and-click  help you<br /><br /></p>

			Dysfunctional Market?</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>In an ABC&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/rn/podcast/feeds/bia.xml"> podcast</a>, Dr Paul Woolley gave an speech on <span style="font-style: italic;">Financial Sector Dysfunctionality</span>. Indeed, witnessing series of financial stuff-up&rsquo;s in last centuries, one bigger than the other,  shouldn&rsquo;t we slow down and take a good look at this interesting business sector?<br /><br />Paul used his personal experience in the adoption of momentum trading to illustrate some recent worrying changes  in the financial market. I don&rsquo;t think I can paraphrase very well, so please read full transcript <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/rn/bigideas/stories/2008/2149972.htm">here</a>.<br /><br />These days, financial sector is growing faster and larger, and taking increasing bigger share in  GDP. It is, however, not entirely a result of the sector doing a better job as an intermediary between investor and borrower. Instead, especially after the rise of hedge funds, more and more financial operations are making profit from market volatility or other speculative behaviors. The money changed hand in the process has far exceeded the actual value of the annual global output. Does it make sense at all?<br /><br />We can always reduce the phenomena to human greed and fear. In the other word, a financial market is for speculators to speculate, just like what Las Vegas is for gamblers.<br /><br />But, could it be something more? If we know it is wrong and yet we fail for it decades after decades, could it be something more hideous that&rsquo;s lurking in our collective psychology?<br /><br />Could it be similar to the construction of the Pyramids in Ancient Egypt? When a society make a collective economic choice and believe that a certain non-productive, expensive activities, conducted by a handful of elites, should be handsomely rewarded by the general public at large, is it a social/organizational problem?<br /><br />For argument sake, let&rsquo;s assume it is. Then what purpose it serves? Could it be just a natural device to stabilize human population (e.g. to creating a underclass who either died of starvation or illness), or an essential mechanism to hold a society together (akin to a common religious experience)?<br /><br /><div style="text-align: left;">Actually the religious analogy can be further developed.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_j_Rnsthw-6Y/R7qxdFFu8QI/AAAAAAAAAEw/PVk0gHeVPqU/s1600-h/money_whopship.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; cursor: pointer;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_j_Rnsthw-6Y/R7qxdFFu8QI/AAAAAAAAAEw/PVk0gHeVPqU/s320/money_whopship.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5168638635501613314" border="0" /></a></div><br /><ul><li>The various indexes are like the Oracle. It may or may not tell the future direction of the economy. </li><li>The big financial houses are like Temples. High priests are there to talk to the Gods.</li><li>Their royal servants, me included, dutifully takes up the responsibility of all daily housekeeping activities and, most important of all, money collection. We highlight the blessing one will receive if they sacrifice all their income to our product, and unconceivable suffering if they do not put away their for investment.</li><li>Occasionally we have good news to the people: &ldquo;Rejoice, the Oracle of Gods hath spoken. A new era has come. Sell all your belonging and buy the stocks of these websites!&rdquo;</li></ul>Well, I think you have got the idea.<br /><br />But seriously this topic deserves a more systematic, in-depth treatment.</p>
