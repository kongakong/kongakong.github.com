  <div class="entry-content"><p>I would hardly use the &ldquo;success stories&rdquo; as the authoritative list of companies that use Python.<BR/><BR/>I&rsquo;m the CTO of a large hedge fund and our development platform is primarily Python. And while we are by no means a large firm (in terms of head count), I have been seeing more and more resumes in the finance world of people using Python at large financial firms.<BR/><BR/>As Python is not a &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; language, I think it comes in the back door at organizations so you won&rsquo;t always see it in job postings or other public references. That doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s not used.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the podcast I enjoy a lot listening to lately is the <a href="http://webcast.berkeley.edu/course_details.php?seriesid=1906978276">UC Berkeley History 7B </a>by Professor Jennifer Burns.<br /><br />This course covers US History from Civil War to the present days. Some stories are amazing, some stories make your blood boiled. In about 40 lecture audio (usually about 1 hour in length), one will be able to walk through the path that USA as nation has taken to become what she is today in last 150 years, without the stress of examination and tutorial. Isn&rsquo;t it a good deal?<br /><br />I have learn a lot of interesting thing from this series of podcast. For example, since the Reconstruction, industries in the North started moving to the South to take advantage of the cheap labor and land cost there. The seeking of cheaper production cost is obviously not a recent phenomenas. Coupled with today&rsquo;s technology, the shift of production base has a even wider and farther reaches. No longer confined within a national/cultural border, production process are either continuing to move South to Mexico or relocated to overseas (such as China) altogether.<br /><br />Now, after 20 years of development, the production cost of China finally starts to rise. The factory owners immediately respond to it and moving the plants to other cheaper location such as Bangladesh or Vietnam.<br /><br />Public sentiment in developed countries, without exception, always blames &lsquo;Other People&rsquo; for &lsquo;stealing&rsquo; their jobs. The blame is laid on the wrong subjects.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One should not invest for the sake of &ldquo;being in the market&rdquo; or &ldquo;Income&rdquo;. When one is making stock selection, he/she should take both income and potential of appreciation into account.<br /><br />The only way to begin is learn by doing. An investor can invest in a handful of stock. The situation of the market will force the investor to think about buying, selling or holding. It is much better than &ldquo;paper transactions&rdquo; that many tyros indulges, because the real holdings test the investor&rsquo;s psychological reactions.<br /><br />And this imply that one must invest time to study investments.<br /><br />This initial experience fund should be very small, ideally not over 1o% of one&rsquo;s asset. And time. If time is an issue, then you may be better off delegate the investment decision to the professional. This exercise also help you to discover if you are cut out for trading.<br /><br />The author argues that beginner should do more short-term investing. Some people believe that there is more peace of mind if one simply keeps a stock for a long pull. Experience seems to contradict this claim. It is because many &lsquo;long term&rsquo; investors ignore change of market condition. They may be correct in short term, but may pay a dear price in the long run.<br /><br />Short term method requires the closing of a trade for a good reason. If the condition changes again, then one can choose to re-establish a position again.<br /><br /><br /><br /><span><span style="font-size: 85%;"><span style="font-style: italic;"> Quick link to </span><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0471132977?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thoonvarsub-20&amp;link_code=wql&amp;camp=212361&amp;creative=380601">The Battle for Investment Survival</a><span style="font-style: italic;"> by Gerald M.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Python is used widely in academia, open source projects and start-up. However, when it comes to the corporate world,   it seems to me it is not making a lot of inroad. At least this is true in the finance industry, which I am more familiar with.<br /><br />A quick check on the python.org&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.python.org/about/success/">success stories</a>, only two companies are listed as Fortune 500, and none of them is in the finance.<br /><br />Occasionally there are ads looking for people with python skill in the financial sector, but the positions are usually of support or operation nature, not application development.<br /><br />From first glimpse, it is a classic chicken-and-egg problem: there is not enough skillful python programmers out there to fill the jobs, it is difficult to start new projects in python. However, if python programming job market is weak, there is little incentives for students or programmers to pick up this non-mainstream language.<br /><br />But there is something more than just supply-demand. I believe a common perception that, somehow, dynamic scripting languages are <span style="font-style: italic;">not for large scale projects</span> and is <span style="font-style: italic;">difficult to maintain</span> also make people shy away from using Python.<br /><br />The <span style="font-style: italic;">not for large scale projects</span> argument is a not too hard to counter. We just need to find some good examples of high visibility. For example, <a href="http://groups.google.com/">Google Groups</a> and <a href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/">mercurial.</a><br /><br />However, there may not be a clean-cut answer to the question of maintainability. First of all, we have a generation of programmers who have used to statically typed languages and their accomplishing IDEs (such as Java and Eclipse). To this group of audience, the idea that one can build a full-fledged application using just API documentation, command line tools and vi/emacs is beyond imagination. It is easy to conclude that, without IDE support, it is difficult to refactor the code base, which is an essential step in keeping the application in good heath.<br /><br />Secondly past experience may still leave a bad taste. If you have done maintenance of legacy applications written in perl, some of them could make you feel like you have just visited a programmer&rsquo;s hell. Cryptic code and inconsistent style are everywhere. (But it&rsquo;d still be way better than tcl. Luckily I have not come across any such programs yet). This bad memory certainly make people think twice before embracing dynamic scripting language in general, Python in particular.<br /><br />A disclaimer I must make: what I wrote above is based on my experience only, and your organization may be free of the above issues, especially if yours is relatively smaller in scale (so it is relatively easier to innovate) or relatively young (so there are less legacy applications). But today in most of the giant, multinational financial institutions that inspire to be a &ldquo;financial supermarket&rdquo; for all, the decision markers, especially the &ldquo;professional manager&rdquo; type, have a total different mind-set. First of all they will not be benefited much, personally, by giving green light to the use of non-mainstream technology/language that <span style="font-style: italic;">promise </span>better result and higher productivity. On the other hand, they have everything to lose if the brave decision does not deliver.  Java (or C# if it is a MS Window shop) is always a safe bet, even though it means one need an army of programmers to get thing done. In essence, it is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal-agent_problem">agency problem</a>.</p>
