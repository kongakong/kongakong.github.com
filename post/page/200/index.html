  <div class="entry-content"><p>A discussion named &ldquo;String as List&rdquo; has been running, at the time of writing, for 6 days and 56 posts already. A lot of interesting idea and insight into Erlang were poured into this discussion. I simply want to write down some interesting technical points in this blog as a digest, as a reference. <em><br /><br />It all started with a question from <span class="HcCDpe"><span email="tsuraan@gmail.com" class="EP8xU" style="color: rgb(0, 104, 28);">tsuraan</span>:<br /><br /></span><blockquote style="font-style: italic;">&ldquo;Why does erlang internally represent strings as lists?&rdquo;</blockquote><br />First response from <span class="HcCDpe"><span email="masklinn@masklinn.net" class="EP8xU" style="color: rgb(121, 6, 25);">Masklinn</span><span class="lDACoc">, and actually many other contributors share the same idea:<br /></span></span><blockquote style="font-style: italic;"><span class="HcCDpe"><span class="lDACoc"><br /></span></span>&ldquo;A lot of functional languages represent strings as lists rather than<br />arrays because lists are their basic collection datatype, and this allows the use of all the list-related functions on strings.&rdquo;</blockquote><br /><span class="HcCDpe"><span email="chsu79@gmail.com" class="EP8xU" style="color: rgb(91, 16, 148);">Christian S </span> put it in a shorter phrase: &ldquo;historical reason&rdquo;. As he pointed out, &ldquo;internal&rdquo; is not right word in the question because string was not a special type or abstraction built on top of list. A string is a list.<br /><br />He then suggested the following module for handling large text:<br /></span><br /><blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">&ldquo;&ndash; binaries (features representation that is 1:1 with the character</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">encoding itself, now also (R12B) with efficient scanning and</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">tail-construction)</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">&ndash; iolists (features cheap concatenation of large texts)</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">&ndash; list of words and a word-dictionary (features quicker scanning of words, efficient storage too)&rdquo;</span><span class="HcCDpe"><br /></span></blockquote><span class="HcCDpe"><span class="lDACoc">Then </span></span><span class="HcCDpe"><span email="kevin@scaldeferri.com" class="EP8xU" style="color: rgb(204, 0, 96);">Kevin Scaldeferri </span></span><span class="HcCDpe"><span class="lDACoc">throws in a different point: list is not a good representation because<br /><br /></span></span><blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;" class="HcCDpe"><span class="lDACoc">&ldquo;</span></span><span style="font-style: italic;">First off, I append to strings a lot more than I prepend to them.  Yeah, I</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;"> could work with reversed strings, but that&rsquo;s a hack to deal with using the </span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">wrong data type.  Plus, I probably prefix match more often than suffix matching</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">(although this is less lopsided than append vs. prepend) &hellip;&rdquo;</span><br /></blockquote><br />Now we have a diversion, <span class="HcCDpe"><span email="vlm@lionet.info" class="EP8xU" style="color: rgb(0, 131, 145);">Lev Walkin </span></span>responded to earlier Robert&rsquo;s post about that list is an ideal string representation because it can easily accommodate UTF-16 and UTF-32.<br /><br /><blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">&ldquo;Small correction: UTF-16 and UTF-32 are practically dead, you certainly</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">need to think in terms of UTF-8 nowadays.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><br /></blockquote><span class="HcCDpe">Now we are going to have several threads going on under the same thread subject. Let&rsquo;s get to it in my next blog. But for now I will ignore UTF-8 vs UTF16/32 discussions in order to focus on Erlang features.<br /><br />End of Part 1<br /><span class="lDACoc"></span></span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;"></em> It is about summarization, so quote will be edited liberally for clarity, rather than reproduced word for word.<br /></span></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I write this blog, I fully expect this information, given the exponential growing digital archive storage, will be kept for prosperity eternally.<br /><br />As long as we can capture all these information in digital form of which, I can assure you, this tiny article is already in, then you, my dear reader, will always be capable of reaching this article, as long as you are so determined to know something about me.<br /><br />The problem is: now since we remember so well, we are losing the ability to <span style="font-style: italic;">forgive and forget</span>.<br /><br />For example, some people made mistakes. Some people made mistakes occasionally, some people made mistakes all too often. We probably do not want to give forgiveness to perpetual liers, but we also should not dwell on one&rsquo;s bad move, which could be a result of poor judgment or simply circumstantial.<br /><br />But today, every records are digitized. We can crosschecked records in A against records in B. Past stories no longer faded into oblivion with time.<br /><br />As if they are trapped in a perpetual time capsule whose accessibility,  paradoxically, is just a mouse click away.<br /><br />A new generation of offenders now are the all-reaching social networks. It expands, it keeps tracks, it feeds on your personal information. Your misdeeds, once made public, by your own hands or not, will be instantly available to the World, and can never be retracted.<br /><br />Your friend and your acquaintance will  never forget too.<br /><br />Those who watched will remember, those who had not will attempt to find out, those forgot can search to refresh the memory.<br /><br />How will this impact human collective EQ is yet to be seen.<br /><br />But I am glad this gives me a legitimate excuse to create a new word: <span style="font-style: italic;">Oversocialnetworkisation</span>.<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">(The only worry is: the above &ldquo;manifesto&rdquo; makes me sound a bit like the </span><a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Kaczynski">Unibomder</a><span style="font-style: italic;">&hellip;)<br /><br /></span></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In an ABC&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/rn/podcast/feeds/bia.xml"> podcast</a>, Dr Paul Woolley gave an speech on <span style="font-style: italic;">Financial Sector Dysfunctionality</span>. Indeed, witnessing series of financial stuff-up&rsquo;s in last centuries, one bigger than the other,  shouldn&rsquo;t we slow down and take a good look at this interesting business sector?<br /><br />Paul used his personal experience in the adoption of momentum trading to illustrate some recent worrying changes  in the financial market. I don&rsquo;t think I can paraphrase very well, so please read full transcript <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/rn/bigideas/stories/2008/2149972.htm">here</a>.<br /><br />These days, financial sector is growing faster and larger, and taking increasing bigger share in  GDP. It is, however, not entirely a result of the sector doing a better job as an intermediary between investor and borrower. Instead, especially after the rise of hedge funds, more and more financial operations are making profit from market volatility or other speculative behaviors. The money changed hand in the process has far exceeded the actual value of the annual global output. Does it make sense at all?<br /><br />We can always reduce the phenomena to human greed and fear. In the other word, a financial market is for speculators to speculate, just like what Las Vegas is for gamblers.<br /><br />But, could it be something more? If we know it is wrong and yet we fail for it decades after decades, could it be something more hideous that&rsquo;s lurking in our collective psychology?<br /><br />Could it be similar to the construction of the Pyramids in Ancient Egypt? When a society make a collective economic choice and believe that a certain non-productive, expensive activities, conducted by a handful of elites, should be handsomely rewarded by the general public at large, is it a social/organizational problem?<br /><br />For argument sake, let&rsquo;s assume it is. Then what purpose it serves? Could it be just a natural device to stabilize human population (e.g. to creating a underclass who either died of starvation or illness), or an essential mechanism to hold a society together (akin to a common religious experience)?<br /><br /><div style="text-align: left;">Actually the religious analogy can be further developed.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_j_Rnsthw-6Y/R7qxdFFu8QI/AAAAAAAAAEw/PVk0gHeVPqU/s1600-h/money_whopship.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; cursor: pointer;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_j_Rnsthw-6Y/R7qxdFFu8QI/AAAAAAAAAEw/PVk0gHeVPqU/s320/money_whopship.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5168638635501613314" border="0" /></a></div><br /><ul><li>The various indexes are like the Oracle.

A new era has come. Sell all your belonging and buy the stocks of these websites!&rdquo;</li></ul>Well, I think you have got the idea.<br /><br />But seriously this topic deserves a more systematic, in-depth treatment.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just think it may be worthwhile to commit it in writing for sharing.<br /><br />In summary, my decision is only partially based on the technical merit or language features.<br /><br />First take a look back at year 2001. Motivated by the desire to find a better, more reliable way to develop software, I learned and switched to Linux platform in this year. For anyone serious in learning unix family OS,  <span style="font-style: italic;">bash</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">awk</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">sed </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">perl </span>scripting are literally the &ldquo;basic dance steps&rdquo;.<br /><br />Then I moved on to Python (see my first blog if you have plenty of time to waste :&ndash;) ).<br /><br />Now fast forward a few years. From Python, I soon learn about these big names such as <a href="http://www.python.org/%7Eguido/">Guido van Rossum</a> and <a href="http://norvig.com/">Peter Norvig</a> etc, and for some reasons, stumbled upon  <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/">Paul Graham</a> and his famous essays.<br /><br />One of his famous idea on computer language is: there are reasons why some languages are superior than other languages, and Lisp <span style="font-style: italic;">is </span>the most powerful among them. (Alright, I made the assertion for him, he probably never really put it exactly this way. Did he?)<br /><br />So, convinced by the argument that a language is key to a programmer&rsquo;s productivity, I decided to give Lisp a try. The syntax, or the lack of it, is indeed a challenge, but the concept of &ldquo;code is data, data is code&rdquo; is very powerful. <a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/macros-standard-control-constructs.html">Macros</a> and <a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/object-reorientation-generic-functions.html">CLOS </a>are effective techniques in Lisp programming.<br /><br />Fortunately there are a lot of resource.<br /><br />Actually I should put it this way: &ldquo;too much resource&rdquo;.<br /><br />Indeed, if you look at variety in the implementations of mainstream Lisp, and its derivative, Scheme, you will find these choices: Common lisp (clisp), CMUCL (CMU lisp), Kawa (Scheme on JVM), PLT Scheme, Scheme 48 etc&hellip; The list goes on and on.<br /><br />It is the common phenomena of *nix world: the Fragmentation.<br /><br />As a result, for any partitioner in commercial software world, it becomes a hard problem: given limited free time for self-study, we are confronted with these choices:<br /><ul><li>which language (Lisp or Scheme)?</li><li>which version (R5RS or R6RS or some subset, in the case of Scheme)?</li><li>which implementation of the language (the usual portability vs power/library issue)?</li></ul>It makes my research long and tedious. If I bet on a wrong horse, I will lose a lot of valuable time, right? What if I am in a middle of a project and encounter a bug in the lisp/scheme interpreter I am using, will there be adequate community support? What if&hellip;<br /><br />Does the risks justify the potential gain from the use of Lisp/Scheme?<br /><br />Then I discovered Erlang.<br /><br />The following reasons make me think, form my particular situation and career need, Erlang is probably the safest  bet (or most cost-effective investment):<br /><br /><ul><li>It has all the beauty and expressiveness of a functional language</li><li>You gain concurrency for free (built-in support in syntax and kernel)<br /></li><li>You gain fault tolerance for free</li><li>You gain distributed processing for free</li><li>The language and library are robust and battle-tested in demanding Telecom industry.</li><li>It does not suffer from the implementation fragmentation of Lisp/Scheme.</li><li>The language evolution is well controlled (by Ericsson)<br /></li></ul>It is a pragmatic choice from a software builder&rsquo;s point of view.</p>
