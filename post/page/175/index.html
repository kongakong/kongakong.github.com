			A New Energy Future</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It is an absolutely fascinating talk by <a href="http://www.jcvi.org/">Craig Venter</a>.<br /><br /><a href="http://fora.tv/2008/02/25/Joining_3_5_Billion_Years_of_Microbial_Invention">Joining 3.5 Billion Years of Microbial Invention</a><br /><br />Very well worth your 1 hr 45 min of your life.<br /><br />Craig has actually covered a lot of subjects. A board outline here will not do justice to the brilliant talk, but I do it anyway:<br /><br />Craig first recounted his oceanic expedition in which he sailed around the world and collected micro-organism in seawater every 200 miles for genome sequencing. On his way he has met French who jealously guarded their &ldquo;genetic heritage&rdquo; in French Polynesians territory, and even detained by British navy for a while.<br /><br />The result is an astonishing proof of the richness and diversity of our eco-system.<br /><br />Each local area has its own set of unique, diverse micro-organism. But due to modern logistic, these micro-organism are transported to different part of the world by our vessels. When anchoring in destination ports, large container ships discard sea waters which they have pumped up from, possibly, another part of the world far far away. Imagine the magnitude of the evolution challenge to the local species when millions of new, alien micro-organism are being released, along with the sea water, into the local environment on a regular basis.<br /><br />Craig also described the mechanism to build a custom-design chromosomes. He emphasized that the scientists are not playing God. The technique is only possible because the microbial has invented the underlying mechanism through 3.5 billion years of evolution.<br /><br />Lastly he introduced the vision of the 4th Generation Biofuel, a fuel that is generated by engineered bacteria using solely CO2 and solar energy (whereas the 2nd and 3rd generations of technology still require sugar as input to the process). It is a better solution because, comparing ethanol solution, the generated fuel can contain more energy per unit, does not absorb water and will not bid up the food price.</p>

			Investment Survival Note 4 - Pitfalls for the Inexperienced</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>For any beginners in the stock market, they should try to gain experience by trading in the active , listed stocks. The beginners should learn to control their emotions through this exercise. After this  they can start to choose a particular subset of the market to focus on and trade exclusively. The idea that someone can trade equity, bond, IPO, OTC and other exotic products equally well all at the same time is absurd. In today&rsquo;s world the advantage of <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">specialization </span>is already evident. The same holds true in capital preservation.<br /><br />The main advantages of investing in leader stocks are the following: The transaction fee is usually cheaper, and it is possible to monitor the stock performance daily.<br /><br />Beginners should avoid IPO because the prices are usually mispriced on the high side. Even if the IPO price is lower than fair value of the underlying, it will immediately lead to over-subscription. The amount allocated will be so small that it is hardly profitable.<em><br /><br />Secondly beginners should avoid buying shares directly from broker/dealer. We can hardly expect the salesman to be unbiased when they try to sell you their holdings.<br /><br />One should also avoid <a href="http://www.investorwords.com/4421/secondary_distribution.html">secondary distribution</a> because of the lack of price transparency.<br /><br />Lastly, simply avoid the promoter, the penny stock and stock with romantic titles.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-style: italic;"></em> I believes many &ldquo;investors&rdquo; in Hong Kong will dispute this.<br /><br /></span></span><br /><br /><span><span style="font-size: 85%;"><span style="font-style: italic;"> Quick link to </span><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0471132977?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thoonvarsub-20&amp;link_code=wql&amp;camp=212361&amp;creative=380601">The Battle for Investment Survival</a><span style="font-style: italic;"> by Gerald M.

		<p>By happenstance I picked up the book &ldquo;<a type="amzn" asin="0071416641">Using the Wall Street Journal</a>&rdquo; (5th Ed.) by Michael B. Lehmann. This book has been sitting idly on my bookshelves, gathering dust, for a very, very long time.<br /><br />On p. 99, there is a reprint of a news story published on 30, Jan 1995. In which it reported,<br /><br /><blockquote style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Greenspan Defends Moves</span><br /><br />The Fed has been criticised for raising interest rates before seeing any evidence of worsening inflation, but Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan replied in remarks prepared for delivery over the weekend: &ldquo;If we have waited until inflation had become evident, it would have been too late.&rdquo;</blockquote><br />A lot has been changed since then.</p>

			Common Questions About Working as a Python Developer</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I haven&rsquo;t posted much recently because I am starting a new job. It is the third time I switched language. Now, I am officially a Python Developer. Hurray!<br /><br />Since I have always kept myself busy by constantly picking up new computer languages, I know a dozen of odd and exotic languages. Therefore, after I landed on this job, I am surprised by some &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; questions about Python that people asked. And these people are no amateur. They are C or Java developers by profession.<br /><br />Here are the questions:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">1) What is Python?</span><br /><br /><blockquote>Well, it is a dynamic scripting language. A good overview <a href="http://www.python.org/about/">here</a>.<br /><br />To emphasize that it is a <span style="font-style: italic;">real </span>programming language, I&rsquo;d also add that Python is used very <span style="font-style: italic;">extensively </span>within Google.<br /><br /></blockquote><br /><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">2) Isn&rsquo;t Python an very old language?</span><br /><br /><blockquote>Oh, this question makes me feel like I am the last Eyak speaker!<br /><br />Python appeared in 1991 when the creator <a href="http://www.python.org/%7Eguido/">Guido van Rossum</a> released it to the public. It is actually a very young language.<br /><br />Let&rsquo;s compare other still active languages and the time of first appearance:<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ruby</span> &ndash; 1995<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Java</span> &ndash; 1995<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Visual Basic</span> (VB4 to VB.Net) &ndash; 1995<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lua</span> &ndash; 1993<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Perl </span>&ndash; 1987<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Erlang</span> &ndash; 1987<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">C++</span> &ndash; 1983<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">C </span>&ndash; 1972<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cobol</span> &ndash; 1959<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fortran</span> &ndash; 1957<br /><br />The debut of Python is a rather recent event in the history of computer language chronologically.<br /><br />But another meaning implied by &lsquo;Old&rsquo; is related to the vitality or dynamism of the language. A low public profile seems to indicates there is not much going on in this language.<br /><br />It is entirely a matter of perception.<br /><br />To me, python never feels old. The language is continuously improving and evolving. The community is healthy and the members on the mailing list are friendly, helpful and intelligent. The language users are willing to embrace <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3000">changes</a> to make Python better.<br /><br />It is in stark contrast with Java. The discussion of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Closure</span> has highlighted the inertia of the Java language.<br /><br />But don&rsquo;t get me wrong: in other arena of Java eco-system, there are still a lot of energy and innovation such as <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/">OpenJDK</a>. OpenJDK may even eventually force the hand of Microsoft to open-source their CLR. (Hopefully)<br /></blockquote><br /><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">3) Is Python more powerful than Java?<br /></span><br /><blockquote>Wow, it is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flamebait">dangerous questions</a>! My <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_correctness">PC</a> answer is: they are designed for different tasks, and each of them have their distinct advantages in the problem domain that these languages are created to serve.<br /><br />Besides, everyone has their own notion of Powerfulness. We will end up comparing orange to apple.<br /><br />For me, power is only one of the consideration. Python&rsquo;s readability is another attractive feature. While Python cannot stop a programmer from writing cryptic code, at least it spares you the eyesore caused by bizarre programming styles that some &lsquo;gifted&rsquo; programmers use.<br /><br /></blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">4) Isn&rsquo;t Python dead?<br /><br /></span><blockquote><span>The news of Python&rsquo;s death is largely exaggerated.<br /><br /><br /></span><br /><br /></blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">Postscript</span>:<br /><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"></span><br /><ul><li>I think the latest announcement of <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine">Google App Engine</a> will make a wider audience aware of Python and how good it is.<br /><br /></li><li>Lately a lot of innovation in programming languages (groovy, python and erlang for example) have an European root. Is it a sign that US has under-invested in research in both public and private sections?</li></ul></p>

			Investment Survival Note 3 - Is There an Ideal Investment?</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; color: rgb(102, 0, 0);"></span>From the Auther&rsquo;s point of view, an ideal investment vechicle is one that will repay income and principle in units of the same purchasing power as was originally invested. As far as we know, this kind of investment does not exist.<br /><br />To quote,<br /><blockquote style="font-style: italic;"><br />&ldquo;It is not hard to see why it should be merely a theoretical formula. Nothing is safe; nothing is sure in any field of life. Specifically the wealth of the world does not increased fast enough to allow payment of compound interest or pyraminding of profits on existing &#8220;invested captial&rdquo;. Every so often adjustment are made partly through bankruptcies and other scaling down of obligations and partly through deprecation. And it&rsquo;s all as old as the hills.&ldquo;</blockquote><br /><br />I find this passage specially relevant to the current sub-prime crisis. An triple A rating from a rating agency is never a guarantee of performance.<br /><br /><br /><br /><span><span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-style: italic;"> Quick link to </span><a style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;" type="amzn" asin="0471132977">The Battle for Investment Survival</a><span style="font-style: italic;"> by Gerald M.
