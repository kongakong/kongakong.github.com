			Investment Survival Note 7 - Sound Accounting for Investors</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>As an investor it is important to do proper accounting to keep track of  the P/L of his/her holdings. Ideally the holding should be marked to market frequently if not monthly. All cost and income should be recorded. It helps an investor to have a realistic picture of the health of  his/her investment.<br /><br />An investor should also maintain a reserve account which sets aside cash for tax on realised and unrealised profit.<br /><br />The book was first written in 1936, so, I reckon, it did require work and discipline for average do-it-yourself investors to keep track of P/L back in those days. Today, with all these online resources such as Yahoo Finance, it is a lot easier to do so. <br /> <br /><br />Quick link to <a style="font-style: italic;" type="amzn" asin="0471132977">The Battle for Investment Survival</a>  by Gerald M.

I always want to learn more about it, but never really have the time until recently.<br /><br />The more I understand Go, the more I appreciate the beauty of the game.<br /><br />The basic move is extremely simple: If you want to capture an enemy, just place sufficient numbers of your pieces surrounding the target such that they are completely cut off from their kind, then they become your PoW.<br /><br />In order to win, a player must occupy a bigger territory than his/her opponents at the end of the game.<br /><br />However, I can assure you that you cannot achieve this goal by simply just battling your enemy  out.<br /><br />In fact, focusing too much on winning individual battles may end up costing you the ultimate victory.  Simply put, since it usually takes more pieces to take over enemy land, if you spend your resources (i.e. pieces) to warring, instead of territory building, you may risk not occupying enough land. Battles should only be a mean to secure your territory or weaken your opponent, not an end in itself.<br /><br />How does it related to life? Well, sometimes don&rsquo;t we focus too much on immediate, short-term gain (akin to capturing enemy pieces in Go), and forget our bigger pictures in life?</p>

			My First Mac and Virtual Box Experience</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I am officially a Mac convert.<br /><br />Still learning how to survive on one mouse button and use these fn, control, option and command keys. But so far so good. My MBP experience is absolutely positive.<br /><br />Before the purchase, I was slightly worried about if I may pay too much for a fine GUI. After last few days of hand-on experience, I think, as many MBP users has attested, the premium is well worth it.<br /><br />I, in particular, appreciate the BSD root of Mac OSX.  Whenever I cannot use the Mac OSX GUI to get thing done, I can always fall back to command line alternatives.<br /><br />Vista is a staggering failure of MS Corp in every sense (I have used Vista for a year). As Paul Graham puts it, Microsoft has <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/microsoft.html">ceased to be relevant</a>. They still have market share, but it is a market share going to erode fast, under the attacks of Sun, Linux and FOSS. The unwillingness to waste any more time on Vista is my prime motivation to switch.<br /><br />The very first application I have downloaded is the <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>. Basically within seconds I can start a new virtual instance of Ubuntu 8.04 beta. By default I can only <span style="font-weight: bold;">ssh</span> into the box via NAT. Will need to do some research to see how to get bridging done in Mac OSX.<br /><br />The second application I tried is, not surprisingly, <a href="http://www.blacktree.com/">QuickSliver</a>, an utility that warranted an hour of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4LkTstvUL4">Google Tech Talk</a>.</p>

By coincidence I found this <a href="http://blog.talkingphilosophy.com/?p=269">blog post</a> , by Jean Kazez, soon afterwards, which is related to belief in God as well.<br /><br />I do not think I have much nice thing to say about David Brooks. Let&rsquo;s say I am usually unimpressed by the arguments put foward by David in <a href="http://www1.pbs.org/newshou"><span style="font-style: italic;">Shields and Brooks</span></a> on PBS. Not because he is a Right-wing political pundit per se, but because what his reasoning and arguments are usually not very grounded. I still watched the PBS program because what he has to say, it seems to me, a good indicators of the current conservative sentiments and stances on issues.<br /><br />But this article, which first appeared in NYT in case you may not know, articulated the issue of the current wave of <span style="font-style: italic;">militant materialism</span> against the Religion rather well. Two outstanding icons in this movement are Richard Dawkin and Christopher Hitchens.<br /><br />My primary reservation about Richard and Christopher&rsquo;s position is: If we apply reduction blindly, and dismiss phenomena in the field of spirituality rather offhandedly, then go on to brand people on opposite side as delusional or stupid, then it is not a scientific approach to study a problem.<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">God exists or not?</span> I like to compare this question to the study of nature of light back in the 17th century. Issac Newton believed light is particle but Descarte thought it is wave. Do you think one side has a particular right to brand the other side delusional and stupid? We should always keep in our mind the limit and boundary of human knowledge and intelligence.<br /><br />Jean&rsquo;s article has given his view on the reasoning  and response from both side of the argument. I agree with the fact he pointed out: both sides are so ready to throw in stock arguments.<br /><br />Overall, between the Militant Materialism and the Militant Evangelicals, there is no dialog going on. Just publicity grabbers grabbing for publicity.<br /><br />A proof of the lack of depth: do take a look at how Christopher Hitchens <a href="http://www.templeton.org/belief/hitchens_miller.html">debated his view</a> against Kenneth Miller in the <a href="http://www.templeton.org/belief/index.html">Templeton Conversation</a>.<br /><br />I was mildly offended when Christopher probed Kenneth&rsquo;s religious background. (Out of the blue, he bought up the question, &ldquo;Incidentally, are you a Christian?&rdquo;, to Kenneth) While it is an effective debate technique, i.e. to highlight one&rsquo;s board identity in order to imply the innate bias, and hence invalidity, in his/her reasoning. It is not right in this debate especially when the opponent is sincere and candid in the discussion.<br /><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_j_Rnsthw-6Y/SCoFEtScbpI/AAAAAAAAAI8/Tr-1FupQw5Y/s1600-h/dialog.jpg"><br /></a></p>
