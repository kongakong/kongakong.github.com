    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Heard this idea from Phillip Blond here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/bigideas/big-society%E2%80%94philip-blond/4217882">http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/bigideas/big-society&mdash;philip-blond/4217882</a></p>

<p>Quote:</p>

<blockquote><p>So, in Britain, housing benefit, for example, you know certain families will be on it for 20 years.  That income stream has probably paid for the original property three times over and there’s no benefit to the tenant and there is no benefit to the government.</p>

<p>What if we could capitalise or front-load these sorts of benefits such that they were
transformative and people were able to bounce themselves out of the situation? … What if we could front-load that, give that to the mother and she could become educated?  It would give her a far greater earning power and deliver far more to the family</p></blockquote>
