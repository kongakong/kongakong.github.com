    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It is my very simple, naive understanding of the love-hate relationship Chales Dicken and USA: Initially Americans like Chales Dicken because of his works. When Chales first visited USA, the host threw a lavish ball for him. However as tour went on, Chales was upset by the lack of idealism in American politics and the mannerism of the people he met. At the end, he fell out with America when he realised the privacy of his novels in USA has costed him a hugh sum of lost income. He wrote of USA in a very negative light after he was back in England. It took years before the relationship was mended.</p>
