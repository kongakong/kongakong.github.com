    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>I think this has been addressed in the responses; it’s not as easy as you’d think, and there are important advantages to the uniform interpretation of methods as “just functions that get called in a funky way”. In Ruby, everything is a method, or an anonymous block, and there are no “free functions”. Python uses the complimentary approach, treating functions as first-class citizens. Both approaches are complete; they are however incompatible, and you can’t easily morph one into the other. (Personally, I find that the criticm of explicit self has about as much merit as the criticism of Python’s use of whitespace.)”</p></blockquote>
