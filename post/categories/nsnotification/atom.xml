    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have created a number of custom UIViewControllers for UICollectionViewCell programmatically (Apple makes it really easy to create good looking GUI. <code>AutoLayout</code> is not as bad as I heard from the blogsphere. But I digress).</p>

<p>Now I want to be able to have these UIViewController to subscribe to an adhoc NSNotification. I have ensured that there is no typo in the my notification name (The name is defined in a header file). I have also make sure the notification is fired on the main thread, like so:</p>

<pre><code>dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(),^{
    [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotificationName:NOTIFICATION_NAME object:self];
});
</code></pre>

<p>However my UIViewControllers still do not receive any notification at all.</p>

<p>It turns out it is because the controllers instances have gone out of scope. I found out by putting a <code>NSLog</code> in the <code>dealloc</code> method. It proves that the controllers have gone out of scope.</p>

<p> In order to keep them around in memory, I added a <code>NSMutableDictionary</code> to keep reference to these controllers. Will test if it has any adverse effect or not.</p>
